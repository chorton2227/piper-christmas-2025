# Exercise 1: Create a Story Page

## 🎯 Goal
Use headings and paragraphs to write a story with proper structure. You'll practice organizing content with the six heading levels and formatting text to make it engaging!

---

## 📋 Instructions

### Step 1: Create Your File
Create a new HTML file called `my-story.html` in your student-workspace folder.

### Step 2: Set Up the HTML Structure
Start with the basic HTML template:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My Story</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your story goes here! -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 3: Add Your Story Title
Add an `<h1>` tag with your story's main title. Remember: only ONE h1 per page!

### Step 4: Create Story Sections
Add at least THREE sections using `<h2>` tags. These could be:
- Chapters (Chapter 1, Chapter 2, etc.)
- Parts of your day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
- Story sections (The Beginning, The Middle, The End)

### Step 5: Write the Story Content
Under each `<h2>`, write at least TWO paragraphs using `<p>` tags. Make your story interesting!

### Step 6: Add Text Formatting
Make your story more engaging by using:
- `<strong>` to emphasize important words
- `<em>` to add emphasis or title references
- `<mark>` to highlight key moments

### Step 7: Add Dividers
Use `<hr>` tags to separate major sections of your story.

3. **Add a Quote:** Format a character's dialogue or a quote using `<br>` tags for line breaks

```

## 💭 Think About It

After completing your story, consider:
1. How did using headings help organize your story?
2. Did text formatting make important parts stand out?
3. Would someone understand your story structure just by reading the headings?

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Problem:** My headings all look the same size!  
**Solution:** Make sure you're using actual heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.), not just making text bold.

**Problem:** My paragraphs run together!  
**Solution:** Each paragraph needs its own `<p>` opening and `</p>` closing tag.

**Problem:** My horizontal line doesn't show up!  
**Solution:** Remember that `<hr>` is self-closing - use `<hr>`, not `<hr></hr>`.

**Problem:** My formatting tags show up as text!  
**Solution:** Check that you're using angle brackets `<` and `>`, not regular brackets or parentheses.
