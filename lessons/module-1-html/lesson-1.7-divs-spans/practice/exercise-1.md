# Exercise 1: About Me Page with Sections

## 📝 Instructions

Create an HTML page called `about-me.html` that organizes your "About Me" content using divs to create clear sections.

## Requirements

1. Create a complete HTML document
2. Add a main heading with your name
3. Create **4 sections** using divs, each with:
   - A section heading (h2)
   - Content (paragraphs, lists, etc.)

4. Suggested sections:
   - Introduction
   - Hobbies
   - Favorites (games, food, colors, etc.)
   - Goals or Dreams

5. Give each div a descriptive class name (e.g., `class="introduction"`)

## Example Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>About Me</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>About [Your Name]</h1>
    
    <div class="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm...</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="hobbies">
        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gaming</li>
            <!-- Add more -->
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Add more sections -->
</body>
</html>
```

## 🎯 Challenge

- Add a 5th section with fun facts about yourself
- Use spans to highlight important words or phrases
- Include a "header" div at the top and "footer" div at the bottom

## 💡 Tips

- Each section div should contain related content
- Use meaningful class names that describe what's in the div
- Add horizontal rules (`<hr>`) between sections for visual separation
- Think about how you'd organize a profile page
