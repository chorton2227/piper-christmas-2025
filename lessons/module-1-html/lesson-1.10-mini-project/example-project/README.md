## ✅ Requirements Met

This example project demonstrates all required elements:

### Structure
- ✅ 4 HTML pages (exceeds minimum of 3)
- ✅ Consistent navigation menu on every page
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure throughout
- ✅ Proper DOCTYPE and HTML structure on all pages

### Content Elements
- ✅ Proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6) on all pages
- ✅ Multiple paragraphs (15+ per page)
- ✅ Multiple lists (both ordered and unordered)
- ✅ 10+ links total (internal and external)
- ✅ 5+ images with alt text
- ✅ Multiple tables with proper structure
- ✅ Comprehensive form with various input types
- ✅ Text formatting (strong, em, mark) used meaningfully

### Semantic HTML
- ✅ `<header>` on every page
- ✅ `<nav>` for navigation
- ✅ `<main>` for primary content
- ✅ `<section>` to group related content
- ✅ `<article>` for independent content pieces
- ✅ `<aside>` for supplementary content
- ✅ `<footer>` on every page

### Quality
- ✅ Properly indented code
- ✅ Consistent structure across pages
- ✅ Well-written, cohesive content
- ✅ All links work (external links are real)
- ✅ Appropriate use of all HTML elements

## 🎯 How to Use This Example

1. **Read through all files** to see how elements are used
2. **Notice the structure** - how pages are consistently organized
3. **See the patterns** - navigation, headers, footers are the same on all pages
4. **Study the semantic elements** - how section, article, aside are used appropriately
5. **Look at the form** - comprehensive example with many input types
6. **Observe the tables** - proper structure with thead, th, and td
7. **Check text formatting** - meaningful use of strong, em, and mark

## 💡 Key Takeaways

### Navigation
- Same navigation on every page
- Links to all pages in the site
- Current page included (for visual indication later with CSS)

### Content Organization
- Each page has a clear focus and purpose
- Content is organized into logical sections
- Headings create a clear outline

### Semantic HTML Benefits
- Clear structure for screen readers
- Better SEO for search engines
- Easier to maintain and update
- Professional code quality

### Forms
- Comprehensive form with multiple input types
- All inputs have proper labels
- Logical grouping of related fields
- Required fields marked appropriately

## 🎨 Note About Images

The image references in this project point to files like:
- `images/minecraft-banner.jpg`
- `images/pc-gaming.jpg`
- `images/console-gaming.jpg`
- etc.

These are **placeholder references**. In your own project, you would:
1. Create an `images` folder
2. Add your actual image files
3. Make sure filenames match exactly (including file extension)

## 📚 Learning from This Example

### What to Copy:
- ✅ The structure and organization
- ✅ How semantic elements are used
- ✅ Proper HTML syntax and nesting
- ✅ Form structure and input types
- ✅ Table structure with headers

### What to Make Your Own:
- ❌ Don't copy the content word-for-word
- ❌ Don't use the same topic
- ❌ Don't use the same page names
- ✅ Create YOUR unique project about YOUR interests

## 🎮 About the Content

This example uses a gaming theme because:
- It's relatable to many students
- Easy to generate multiple pages of content
- Natural fit for all required elements (lists of games, comparison tables, etc.)
- Engaging topic that makes the project fun to build

Your project should be about something **YOU** are interested in!

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Review this example thoroughly
2. Complete your planning worksheet
3. Choose your own topic
4. Build your unique project
5. Meet all requirements
6. Have fun creating!
