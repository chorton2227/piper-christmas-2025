## 💡 Tips

- Save all your files in this folder
- Test images by opening HTML files in browser
- Use placeholder URLs: `https://placehold.co/400x300`
- Every image needs alt text!
- Make alt text descriptive, not generic
- Test different image sizes
- Click all image links to verify they work
- Have fun and be creative!

## 🎨 Using Placeholder Images

For practice, use these placeholder URLs:

```html
<!-- Basic placeholder -->
<img src="https://placehold.co/400x300" alt="Description">

<!-- Colored placeholder with text -->
<img src="https://placehold.co/400x300/4A90E2/FFFFFF?text=My+Image" alt="Description">
```

Change the numbers (width x height) and colors to experiment!

1. Open each file in your browser to view
2. Check that all images display correctly
3. Verify all alt text is descriptive
4. Test clickable images and links
5. Review the answer-key folder to compare approaches
