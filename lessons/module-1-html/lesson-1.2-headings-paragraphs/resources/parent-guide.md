## 🎓 Teaching Tips

### Explain Heading Hierarchy with Outlines
Show her how headings work like a book outline:
- **h1** = Book Title
- **h2** = Chapter Titles
- **h3** = Section Titles within Chapters
- **h4** = Subsections

### Visual Comparison
Open example-1 and have her see the size differences. Ask:
- "Which heading is biggest?"
- "When would you use h6 vs h2?"
- "Why do we need different sizes?"

### Real-World Examples
- Show Wikipedia articles - point out heading structure
- Show blog posts - notice h1 title, h2 sections
- Show recipe sites - see heading organization

### Make it Fun
- Let her write about topics she loves
- Encourage creativity in examples
- Don't be too strict about "proper" content
- Focus on structure and technique

**Goal**: Practice line breaks and formatting
**Time**: 20-30 minutes

**Help if stuck:**
- Help her choose a simple recipe

- Are ingredients clearly listed?
- Are steps in separate paragraphs?
- Does she emphasize key information?
- Is it easy to follow?

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Why can't I use multiple h1 tags?"
- **Explain**: Think of h1 as the book cover - only one!
- **Show**: Open a few websites, count the h1 tags
- **Analogy**: Would a book have two titles on the cover?

### "I want bigger text, can I use h1 everywhere?"
- **Explain**: Headings are for structure, not size
- **Promise**: "We'll learn CSS soon to make any text any size!"
- **Show**: How weird it looks with multiple h1s

### "What's the difference between strong and b?"
- **Simple answer**: "strong is better - use that one"
- **If curious**: "strong means 'important', b just means 'bold'"
- **Don't stress**: Both work, strong is recommended

### "My line breaks don't work!"
- **Check**: Using `<br>` not just pressing Enter in code
- **Show**: HTML ignores regular line breaks in code
- **Demo**: Write text on multiple lines without `<br>`, show it displays on one line

### "Can I put a paragraph inside a heading?"
- **Answer**: No! Headings are short titles
- **Rule**: Headings contain text, paragraphs contain text, but don't nest them
- **Show**: What it looks like if you do (breaks structure)
