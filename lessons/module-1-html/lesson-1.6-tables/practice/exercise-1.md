# Exercise 1: Video Game Collection

## 📝 Instructions

Create an HTML page called `game-collection.html` that displays your video game collection in a table.

## Requirements

1. Create a complete HTML document with proper structure
2. Add a heading: "My Video Game Collection"
3. Create a table with these columns:
   - Game Title
   - Platform (PC, Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, etc.)
   - Genre (Action, Adventure, RPG, Sports, etc.)
   - Rating (out of 5 stars)

4. Add at least **5 games** to your table
5. Use `<th>` for the header row
6. Use `border="1"` so you can see the table lines

## Example Structure

```html
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Game Title</th>
    <th>Platform</th>
    <th>Genre</th>
    <th>Rating</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Minecraft</td>
    <td>PC</td>
    <td>Sandbox</td>
    <td>5/5</td>
  </tr>
  <!-- Add more games here -->
</table>
```

## 🎯 Challenge

- Add a 5th column for "Release Year"
- Include at least 8 games
- Add a paragraph below the table explaining your favorite game

## 💡 Tips

- Think about games you actually play or want to play
- Each game should be its own row (`<tr>`)
- Make sure every row has the same number of cells
- Headers should be in the first row

## ✅ When You're Done

Open your HTML file in a browser and check:
- [ ] Table has clear headers
- [ ] All games are listed with complete information
- [ ] Table has visible borders
- [ ] Data is organized and easy to read
