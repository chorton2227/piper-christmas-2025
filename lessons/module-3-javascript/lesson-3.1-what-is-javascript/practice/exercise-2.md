# Exercise 2: Math Challenge 🧮

## 🎯 Goal
Create a JavaScript math quiz that shows questions and answers in the console!

## 📋 Instructions

### Step 1: Create the HTML File
Create a file called `math-quiz.html` with basic HTML structure

### Step 2: Add Styling (Optional but Fun!)
Add some CSS to make the page look nice:
- Centered content
- Nice background color
- Instructions for opening the console

### Step 3: Create the JavaScript Quiz
In your script tag, create a math quiz with these sections:

#### Section 1: Easy Questions
Print 5 easy math problems and their answers:
- Addition (e.g., 5 + 3)
- Subtraction (e.g., 10 - 4)
- Multiplication (e.g., 6 * 7)
- Division (e.g., 20 / 4)
- One more of your choice

#### Section 2: Medium Questions
Print 3 medium difficulty problems:
- Two-step calculations (e.g., 5 + 3 * 2)
- Problems with parentheses (e.g., (10 + 5) * 2)
- Using modulo (e.g., 17 % 5)

#### Section 3: Word Problems
Solve 2 word problems using JavaScript:
- Example: "If I have 50 dollars and buy 3 items at $12 each, how much money is left?"
- Example: "A game gives you 25 points per level. How many points after 8 levels?"

## 💡 Tips
- Use clear labels for each section
- Show the problem AND the answer
- Format it nicely with lines and spacing
- Use comments to explain each problem
