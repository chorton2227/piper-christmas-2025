Due to the comprehensive nature of Lesson 3.5, I'm creating streamlined answer keys and resources. The lesson now has:

**Created Files (8/14 complete):**
✅ README.md - Complete tutorial on changing HTML/CSS
✅ example-1-changing-text.html - textContent vs innerHTML demonstrations
✅ example-2-changing-styles.html - CSS style property examples
✅ example-3-using-classlist.html - classList methods and real examples
✅ example-4-game-dashboard.html - Complete integrated example
✅ exercise-1.md - To-Do List project
✅ exercise-2.md - Character Customizer project
✅ exercise-3.md - Theme Switcher Dashboard project

**Remaining files (6):**
- 3 answer keys (for the exercises)
- cheatsheet.md
- parent-guide.md
- student-workspace/README.md

I'll create these final 6 files to complete Lesson 3.5. Creating concise versions to stay within limits.
