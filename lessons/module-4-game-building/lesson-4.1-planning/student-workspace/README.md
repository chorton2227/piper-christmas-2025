# Student Workspace - Lesson 4.1

Welcome to your game planning workspace! This is where you'll create your game design document.

## What You'll Do Here

In this folder, you'll create planning documents for your game using the templates provided. You can:

1. Fill out the `game-design-template.md` file
2. Create sketches (draw on paper or use digital tool)
3. Write notes in `planning-notes.md`
4. Track your progress

## Files in This Workspace

- **game-design-template.md** - Complete game design document template
- **planning-notes.md** - Space for brainstorming and notes
- **screen-sketches-template.md** - Text-based template for sketching screens
- **README.md** - This file

## How to Use This Workspace

### Step 1: Brainstorm in planning-notes.md
Write down all your ideas, even if they seem silly. No idea is bad during brainstorming!

### Step 2: Fill Out game-design-template.md
Answer every question carefully. This is your blueprint for building the game.

### Step 3: Sketch Your Screens
Use screen-sketches-template.md or draw on paper. You need 3 screens: Start, Game, and End.

### Step 4: Get Feedback
Show your completed design to someone. Ask:
- Do you understand my game?
- Does it sound fun?
- Is anything confusing?

### Step 5: Refine Your Plan
Make any changes based on feedback.

### Step 6: Move to Lesson 4.2!
Once your plan is complete, you're ready to start building with HTML!
