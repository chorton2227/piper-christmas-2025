# Exercise 1: Plan a Simple Clicker Game

## Goal
Create a complete game design document for a simple clicker/idle game.

## Instructions

You're going to plan your own clicker game! This is one of the easiest game types to build, perfect for your first complete game.

### Step 1: Choose Your Theme (5 minutes)

Pick a theme for your clicker game. What will players be clicking on and collecting?

**Theme Ideas:**
- 🍕 Pizza Shop (click to make pizzas)
- 🎵 Music Studio (click to create songs)
- 🌟 Star Collector (click to catch stars)
- 🏗️ City Builder (click to build buildings)
- 🌱 Garden (click to grow plants)
- 🎨 Art Studio (click to create art)
- 🚀 Space Program (click to launch rockets)
- ⚡ Energy Generator (click to generate power)
- 🎪 Circus (click to perform tricks)
- **Your own idea!**

**My theme:** _______________________________________

### Step 2: Define Your Core Mechanic (10 minutes)

Answer these questions about your clicker game:

**What do players click?**  
_______________________________________

**What do they earn per click?**  
Example: "1 pizza per click"  
_______________________________________

**What can they spend their points on?**  
List at least 3 upgrades:
1. _______________________________________
2. _______________________________________
3. _______________________________________

**What do upgrades do?**  
- Upgrade Type 1: Increases per click  
- Upgrade Type 2: Generates points automatically (per second)  
- Which type is each of your upgrades?

### Step 3: Plan Your Upgrades (15 minutes)

Create a shop with 5 upgrades. Fill out this table:

| Upgrade Name | Cost | Effect | Type |
|-------------|------|--------|------|
| Example: "Helper" | 100 | +1/second | Auto |
| 1. | | | |
| 2. | | | |
| 3. | | | |
| 4. | | | |
| 5. | | | |

**Pricing Tips:**
- First upgrade: 50-100 points
- Each upgrade should cost 3-5× more than the previous
- Make sure players can afford first upgrade within 1 minute

### Step 4: Set a Win Condition (5 minutes)

**How does a player "win" your game?**  
(Clicker games often don't end, but set a goal milestone!)

Examples:
- "Reach 1,000,000 points"
- "Buy all upgrades"
- "Reach 500 points per second"

**My win condition:**

### Step 5: Sketch Your Screen (10 minutes)

Draw your game screen showing:
- The clickable button/object (big in the center)
- Point counter (top)
- Points per second (if you have auto-generation)
- Shop with your 5 upgrades (side panel)
- Any other UI elements

Use the space below or draw on paper:

│                                             │
│  Points: _____    Per Second: _____         │
│                                             │
│  ┌────────────┐   ┌──────────────────────┐ │

│                   │  [Upgrade 4]         │ │
│                   │  [Upgrade 5]         │ │
│                   └──────────────────────┘ │
