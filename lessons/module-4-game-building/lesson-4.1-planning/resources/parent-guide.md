# Parent Guide: Lesson 4.1 - Planning Your Game

## Lesson Overview

**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Conceptual (no coding yet)  
**Goal:** Create a complete game design document before starting to code

This lesson focuses entirely on planning. There's no coding yet - that comes in Lesson 4.2. The goal is to teach your child that good planning makes coding much easier.

---

## What Your Child Will Learn

### Skills Developed
- **Planning and organization** - Thinking before doing
- **Design thinking** - Understanding user experience
- **Goal setting** - Defining clear objectives
- **Creative thinking** - Imagining possibilities
- **Communication** - Explaining ideas clearly
- **Priority management** - Must-have vs nice-to-have

### Why This Matters
Many beginners (kids and adults!) jump straight into coding without a plan. This leads to:
- Getting stuck and frustrated
- Not knowing what to build next
- Code that's messy and hard to fix
- Unfinished projects

Planning first prevents all these problems!

## Your Role as Parent

### ✅ Do This

**Be an Active Listener**
- Ask questions about their game idea
- Help them clarify fuzzy concepts
- Encourage them to think through details

**Provide Reality Checks (Gently)**
- If their scope is too large: "That sounds amazing! Could we start with a simpler version?"
- If it's unclear: "I'm not sure I understand how that works. Can you explain more?"
- If it's too easy: "That sounds good! What would make it more challenging?"

**Help with Sketching**
- Sit with them while they draw screens
- Ask "where does the score go?" "what does the player click?"
- Help them visualize the layout

**Celebrate Creativity**
- Get excited about their ideas
- Praise specific things: "I love how you thought about different difficulty levels!"
- Make them feel like a real game designer

### ❌ Don't Do This

**Don't Take Over**
- Resist the urge to design the game for them
- Let them struggle a bit - that's learning!
- Your role is guide, not designer

**Don't Dismiss Ideas**
- Even if it sounds boring or too simple to you
- They need to build something THEY care about
- Simple games are perfect for learning

**Don't Skip the Planning**
- It might feel tedious, but it's crucial
- Coding without planning = frustration later
- This lesson saves hours of confusion

**Don't Rush**
- Take the full 60 minutes
- Let them think through every question
- Quality planning = easier building

## How to Help

### During Brainstorming (First 15 min)

**Ask Open Questions:**
- "What games do you like? Why are they fun?"
- "What would make this game exciting?"
- "Who would play this game?"
- "What would make someone want to play again?"

**If They're Stuck:**
- Look at the example games together
- Browse simple web games for inspiration
- Think about activities they enjoy (sports, hobbies)
- Start VERY simple - you can always expand

### During Rule Writing (Next 15 min)

**Test Their Logic:**
- "Okay, so I click the button and then what happens?"
- "What if I click the wrong thing?"
- "How do I know if I'm winning?"
- "When does the game end?"

**Help with Clarity:**
- If a rule is vague, ask them to explain more
- Help them write in simple, clear language
- Make sure rules cover all scenarios

### During Sketching (Next 15 min)

**Visual Questions:**
- "Where does the score go?"
- "How big is the game area?"
- "What does the player see when they first open the game?"
- "Show me where I would click"

**Drawing Tips:**
- Boxes and labels are perfect - no art skills needed
- Use different colors to show different screens
- Arrows to show what happens when buttons clicked

### During Feature Planning (Last 15 min)

**Priority Discussion:**
- "Which features are absolutely necessary?"
- "Which would be cool but aren't required?"
- "What can we add later if we have time?"

**Scope Management:**
This is critical! Help them avoid:
- Too many features (scope creep)
- Overly complex mechanics
- Unrealistic goals

**Good conversation:**
> Child: "And then there's 10 levels, and different characters, and you can trade items..."  
> Parent: "Wow, those are all great ideas! Let's write those down as 'nice-to-have' features. What are the 5 things the game MUST have to be playable?"

## Game Type Guidance

Here's how to help them choose the right game type:

### ⭐ Easy / Recommended for First Game

**Clicker/Idle Game**
- Just clicking and numbers going up
- Perfect for learning variables and functions
- Hard to mess up
- Example: Cookie Clicker

**Quiz/Trivia Game**
- Questions and answers
- Great for learning arrays
- Clear structure
- Example: Multiple choice quiz

### ⭐⭐ Medium / Good Second Game

**Reaction Game**
- Click targets before they disappear
- Teaches timers and random positioning
- Visually exciting
- Example: Whack-a-mole

**Text Adventure**
- Story with choices
- Teaches functions and screen management
- Creative freedom
- Example: Choose your own adventure

### ⭐⭐⭐ Hard / Save for Later

**Collection/Catching Game**
- Moving objects, collision detection
- More complex logic
- Requires physics/movement understanding
- Example: Catching falling items

**Puzzle Game**
- Complex state management
- Harder to debug
- Requires strategic thinking
- Example: Memory match (simpler version is doable)

**Advice:** Start with ⭐ Easy, move to ⭐⭐ Medium after success!

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Scope Too Large
**Signs:**
- More than 10 features in "must-have" list
- Complex storylines with multiple paths
- More than 5 different game mechanics
- References to "and then in level 10..."

**Fix:**
- Help them identify the core game
- "Let's get version 1 working, then add more!"
- Remind them professional games take teams months/years

### Unclear Goal
**Signs:**
- Can't explain game in one sentence
- Changes their mind about how it works
- No clear win condition
- "I don't know, you just play..."

**Fix:**
- Ask "what is the player trying to do?"
- "How do you know if you're doing well?"
- "What does winning look like?"

### Too Easy or Too Hard
**Signs:**
- Too easy: "You just click once and win"
- Too hard: "It's basically impossible to win"

**Fix:**
- "What makes it challenging but fair?"
- "How can we make success feel earned?"
- "What would make someone want to try again?"

### No Planning
**Signs:**
- "Can I just start coding?"
- Rushing through questions
- Not writing anything down
- Incomplete answers

**Fix:**
- "Let's make sure we know exactly what we're building"
- "This will save you time later, I promise"
- "Real game developers always plan first"

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "Do we HAVE to do all this planning? Can't we just start coding?"**  
A: Planning saves time later! It's like reading instructions before building LEGO - you'll know exactly what pieces you need and where they go. Plus, real game developers always plan first.

**Q: "What if my idea changes while I'm building?"**  
A: That's totally fine! Plans can be updated. But having a starting plan means you're changing something specific, not starting from scratch.

**Q: "My idea is too simple/boring, isn't it?"**  
A: Simple is PERFECT for learning! A simple, polished game is way better than a complex, broken one. You can always make version 2 with more features.

**Q: "Can I build [insert massively complex game]?"**  
A: That's an awesome goal! Let's figure out what the simplest version of that would look like. We can build a mini-version first, then expand it later.

**Q: "What if I can't draw?"**  
A: You don't need to! Just draw boxes and label them. "This box is the game area. This box is the score." That's perfect.

**Q: "How do I know if my game will be fun?"**  
A: Great question! That's why we plan first - we can think through the gameplay before spending time coding. Also, we'll test it with real people later.

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't know what game to make!"
- Look at example games together
- What games do they already play?
- What skills do they want to practice?
- Start with a clicker - it's easy and fun

### "This is taking forever!"
- Planning feels slow but saves time later
- Would you rather spend 1 hour planning or 5 hours stuck?
- Take a break and come back
- Do one section at a time

### "I want to make [AAA game title]!"
- That's awesome inspiration!
- What's the core fun part of that game?
- Can we make a mini-version of that core idea?
- We're building v1 - it can grow later!

### "I changed my mind about everything!"
- That's okay! Which idea excites you most?
- Let's commit to ONE idea for this project
- Write down other ideas for future projects
- You can always make more games later!
