        <p class="first-paragraph">
            Typography is one of the most important aspects of web design. 
            When used effectively, it can transform a simple webpage into something 
            truly professional and engaging. Good typography makes content easy to 
            read, establishes visual hierarchy, and creates the right mood for your 
            message. In this article, we'll explore how different text properties 
            work together to create beautiful, readable content.

            Text alignment plays a crucial role in how we perceive written content. 
            Left-aligned text is the most common and natural for reading in Western 
            languages. Center alignment works well for headings and short passages. 
            Right alignment is useful for special effects or specific design needs. 
            Justified text, like what you're reading now, spreads words across the 
            full width, creating clean edges on both sides. While it looks neat, it 
            can sometimes create awkward spacing, so it works best with longer paragraphs 
            that have sufficient content to fill the width naturally.
        </p>

        <p class="third-paragraph">
            The spacing between lines, controlled by line-height, significantly impacts 
            readability. Too tight, and text feels cramped and difficult to follow. 
            Too loose, and paragraphs feel disconnected. The sweet spot for body text 
            is usually between 1.4 and 1.6 times the font size. This gives readers' 
            eyes enough breathing room to comfortably move from one line to the next 
            without getting lost or feeling overwhelmed.

        <h3>Important Concepts</h3>
        <ul class="concepts-list">
            <li><strong>Font Size:</strong> The height of text, typically measured in pixels</li>
            <li><strong>Font Weight:</strong> How <span class="bold">bold</span> or <span class="light">light</span> the text appears</li>
            <li><strong>Line Height:</strong> The vertical space between lines of text</li>
            <li><span class="underline">Text Decoration:</span> Adding underlines, <span class="strikethrough">strikethroughs</span>, or other effects</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="conclusion">
            Mastering text properties gives you the power to create professional, 
            readable, and visually appealing web pages. Remember: good typography 
            is invisible—it doesn't draw attention to itself, but rather helps 
            readers focus on your content effortlessly.
