    <h1>My Favorite Things</h1>
    
    <h2>My Favorite Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I absolutely love coding! Every time I write a program and see it work, I feel like a magician. 
       Creating something from nothing with just text and logic is incredibly rewarding.</p>
    <p>Playing video games is another passion of mine. I enjoy adventure games and puzzle games that 
       challenge my brain. Sometimes I wonder if I could code my own game someday!</p>
    <p>Reading takes me to different worlds. I love fantasy books where heroes go on epic quests. 
       My favorite series has dragons, magic, and brave warriors.</p>
    
    <h2>My Favorite Foods</h2>
    <p>Pizza is the ultimate food! Whether it's pepperoni, supreme, or just plain cheese, 
       I could eat pizza every single day and never get bored.</p>
    <p>Chocolate chip cookies fresh from the oven are amazing. The smell fills the whole house 
       and makes everyone happy. Warm, gooey cookies with a glass of cold milk - perfect!</p>
