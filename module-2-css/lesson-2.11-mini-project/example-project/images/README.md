# Image Placeholders

This folder contains placeholder text files for images. In a real project, you would replace these with actual image files (.jpg, .png, etc.).

## Required Images:

1. **minecraft-banner.jpg** (600x300px) - Minecraft landscape with blocky terrain and sunset
2. **minecraft-review.jpg** (500x300px) - Minecraft gameplay showing a player building a house
3. **stardew-valley.jpg** (500x300px) - Stardew Valley farm with crops and animals
4. **pc-gaming.jpg** (400x250px) - Gaming computer with RGB lighting and dual monitors
5. **console-gaming.jpg** (400x250px) - Modern gaming console with controller
6. **mobile-gaming.jpg** (400x250px) - Smartphone displaying popular mobile game

## Where to Find Gaming Images:

- **Unsplash** (https://unsplash.com) - Free high-quality photos
- **Pexels** (https://www.pexels.com) - Free stock photos
- **Pixabay** (https://pixabay.com) - Free images and videos
- **Official game press kits** - Many games offer official screenshots

## CSS Note:

The CSS includes fallback background colors for images, so the site will look good even without actual image files.
