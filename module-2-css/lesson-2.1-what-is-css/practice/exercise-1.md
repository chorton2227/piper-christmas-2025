# Exercise 1: Your First CSS

## 🎯 Goal
Create your first web page with CSS styling! You'll practice adding styles in three different ways.

## 📋 Instructions

### Part 1: Inline Styles
1. Create a new file called `my-styles.html` in the `student-workspace` folder
2. Start with this HTML structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Styles</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Colorful Page!</h1>
    <p>This is my first paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is my second paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

3. Add **inline styles** to:
   - Make the `<h1>` blue and size 40px
   - Make the first paragraph red
   - Make the second paragraph green with a font size of 20px

### Part 2: Test Different Colors
4. Change the heading to a different color (try purple, orange, or pink)
5. Add a background color to one of the paragraphs using `background-color`
6. Open your file in a browser to see the results!

## ✅ Success Criteria
- [ ] File is named `my-styles.html`
- [ ] Heading has a color and font size
- [ ] Both paragraphs have different colors
- [ ] At least one element has a background color
- [ ] File opens in browser and shows colors

## 💡 Tips
- Remember to put styles in quotes: `style="color: blue;"`
- Separate multiple styles with semicolons: `style="color: blue; font-size: 20px;"`
- Don't forget to save your file before viewing in the browser!
- Try right-clicking the HTML file and choosing "Open with" → your web browser

## 🌟 Bonus Challenge
- Add a third paragraph with THREE different styles (color, background-color, and font-size)
- Try using hex colors like `#FF0000` instead of color names
- Add borders to your elements with `border: 2px solid black;`
