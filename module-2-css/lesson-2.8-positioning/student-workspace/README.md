## 🚀 Tips for Success

- **Start Simple:** Begin with relative and absolute
- **Use Colors:** Add backgrounds to see positioning clearly
- **Check Parent Position:** Remember relative containers for absolute children!
- **Test Scrolling:** Make sure your page has enough content
- **Try Different Offsets:** Experiment with top, right, bottom, left values
- **Use Developer Tools:** Inspect elements to see computed positions

---

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

**Element not positioning?**
- Check if it has a position value (not static)
- Verify offset properties are set

**Absolute element in wrong place?**
- Is parent set to `position: relative`?
- Check offset values

**Sticky not sticking?**
- Did you set a `top` value?
- Is there enough content to scroll?
- Check if parent has `overflow: hidden`

**Z-index not working?**
- Element needs a position value
- Higher numbers go on top

Happy positioning! 📍✨
