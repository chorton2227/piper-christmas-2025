# Student Workspace - Lesson 2.2: CSS Selectors

Welcome to your workspace for learning CSS selectors! This is where you'll complete all the practice exercises.

## 📁 What Goes Here?

This folder is for **YOUR** work! As you complete the exercises, create your files here:

### Exercise 1: Element Selectors
- `element-practice.html`
- `element-practice.css`

### Exercise 2: Class Selectors
- `class-practice.html`
- `class-practice.css`

### Exercise 3: Mini Portfolio
- `portfolio.html`
- `portfolio.css`

## 🎯 Getting Started

1. Read the lesson [README.md](../README.md) first
2. Look at the examples in the [examples](../examples/) folder
3. Try the exercises in order (1, 2, 3)
4. Check the [cheat sheet](../resources/cheatsheet.md) when you need help
5. Compare your work with the [answer-key](../answer-key/) folder when you're done

## 💡 Tips

- **Element selectors** style ALL elements of that type (`h1`, `p`, `div`)
- **Class selectors** style specific groups (`.highlight`, `.btn`, `.card`)
- **ID selectors** style one unique element (`#header`, `#main`, `#footer`)
- In HTML: `class="name"` (no dot!)
- In CSS: `.name { }` (with dot!)
- In HTML: `id="name"` (no hash!)
- In CSS: `#name { }` (with hash!)

## ✅ Before You Start

- [ ] Read the main lesson README
