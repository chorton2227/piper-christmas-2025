# Exercise 1: Element Selectors Practice

## 🎯 Goal
Practice using element selectors to style ALL elements of a specific type.

## 📋 Instructions

### Step 1: Create Your Files
1. In the `student-workspace` folder, create two new files:
   - `element-practice.html`
   - `element-practice.css`

### Step 2: HTML Structure
Create an HTML file with:
- A main heading (`<h1>`)
- At least 3 subheadings (`<h2>`)
- At least 5 paragraphs
- One unordered list (`<ul>`) with at least 4 items
- One ordered list (`<ol>`) with at least 3 items
- At least 2 divs with content inside

**Example content:**
- Write about your favorite hobbies
- Create a list of your favorite foods
- Create numbered steps for something you know how to do
- Add different sections in divs

### Step 3: CSS Styling
Using **ONLY element selectors** (no classes or IDs), style your page:

**Required styles:**

1. **body:**
   - Background color of your choice
   - Font family
   - Padding: 20px

2. **h1:**
   - Color of your choice
   - Text aligned to center
   - Font size: 36px
   - Bottom border (at least 2px)

3. **h2:**
   - Different color than h1
   - Font size: 24px
   - Margin top: 30px

4. **p:**
   - Line height: 1.6
   - Color for text
   - Font size: 16px

5. **ul:**
   - Background color
   - Padding: 20px
   - Border on one side

6. **ol:**
   - Different background color than ul
   - Padding: 20px
   - Border on one side (different side or color than ul)

7. **li:**
   - Margin between items
   - Font size: 16px

8. **div:**
   - Background color (different from body)
   - Padding: 20px
   - Margin: 20px 0
   - Border radius: 8px

### Step 4: Test
1. Open your HTML file in a browser
2. Notice how **ALL** elements of each type look the same
3. Every paragraph has the same style
4. Every div has the same style
5. This is the power (and limitation) of element selectors!

## ✅ Checklist
- [ ] Created both HTML and CSS files
- [ ] Linked CSS file to HTML file
- [ ] Used proper HTML structure (<!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, <body>)
- [ ] Included all required elements
- [ ] Styled all required elements using element selectors ONLY
- [ ] No classes or IDs used (save those for the next exercise!)
- [ ] Opened file in browser to test

## 🌟 Bonus Challenges
1. Add more element types (h3, h4, blockquote, etc.) and style them
2. Style the `a` tag (links) with colors and remove underlines
3. Add a `table` element and style it with borders
4. Experiment with the `strong` and `em` elements

## 💡 Things to Notice
- When you style `p`, ALL paragraphs get that style
- When you style `div`, ALL divs look the same
- You can't make one paragraph different from another (without classes!)
- Element selectors are great for consistent, site-wide styling

## ❓ Questions to Think About
1. What if you wanted only SOME paragraphs to be highlighted?
2. What if you wanted some divs to look different from others?
3. When would element selectors be most useful?

*These questions will be answered in Exercise 2 with class selectors!*
