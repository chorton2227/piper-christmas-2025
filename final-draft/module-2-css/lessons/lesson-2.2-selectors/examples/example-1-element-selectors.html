    <h1>Element Selectors Demo</h1>
    
    <p>
        This example demonstrates element selectors. All paragraphs will have the 
        same styling because we're targeting the &lt;p&gt; element itself.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What are Element Selectors?</h2>
    
    <p>
        Element selectors target ALL elements of a specific type. Notice how ALL 
        paragraphs on this page have the same font size and color.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Examples of Elements Being Styled</h2>
    
    <p>
        Every paragraph element gets styled exactly the same way. This is useful 
        for setting consistent typography across your entire website.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>All list items also share the same style</li>
        <li>They get styled together as &lt;li&gt; elements</li>
        <li>This creates visual consistency</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Smaller Heading</h3>
    
    <p>
        Even this paragraph, way down here, has the same styling as all the 
        others because they're all &lt;p&gt; elements!
    </p>
    
    <div>
        This is a div. It has different styling because divs are a different 
        element type from paragraphs.
    </div>
    
    <div>
        All divs also share their styling. See how both divs look the same?
