# Student Workspace

## Welcome to Your Typography Studio! ✍️

This is your personal workspace for practicing fonts and text styling! Get ready to make beautiful, readable text that enhances your web pages.

## What You'll Create

For this lesson, you'll create three projects:

1. **text-styles.html** - Practice basic text properties (size, weight, alignment)
2. **font-explorer.html** (+ CSS file) - Showcase different web-safe fonts
3. **blog-post.html** (+ CSS file) - Create a beautiful blog post with Google Fonts

## Getting Started

1. **Create your files** right here in this folder
2. **Experiment with fonts** - try different combinations!
3. **Check readability** - make sure text is easy to read
4. **Have fun** - typography is creative and expressive!

## Tips for This Workspace

- 📝 **Start simple** - Master web-safe fonts before moving to Google Fonts
- 🎨 **Think about mood** - Fonts create feelings (playful, serious, elegant)
- 👀 **Test readability** - Squint at your text. Can you still read it?
- 🔤 **Limit fonts** - Use 2-3 maximum per page
- 📏 **Size matters** - Body text should be at least 16px

## Font Selection Guide

**For Headings:**
- Bold, attention-grabbing
- Can be decorative
- Larger size (32-48px)

**For Body Text:**
- Easy to read
- Not too decorative
- Good size (16-18px)
- Comfortable line spacing (1.5-1.8)

## Quick Reference

```css
/* Make text bigger */
font-size: 24px;

/* Make text bold */
font-weight: bold;

/* Center text */
text-align: center;

/* Add space between lines */

```

2. Find a font you like
3. Click "Get Font" then "Get embed code"
4. Copy the `<link>` into your HTML `<head>`
5. Use it in CSS: `font-family: 'Font Name', sans-serif;`

- [ ] Are my headings clearly different from body text?
- [ ] Did I use appropriate font sizes?
- [ ] Is there enough space between lines?
