## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with Challenge 1, then work your way up
2. **Test Often**: Use console.log to check your random numbers
3. **Copy Examples**: Look at the example files for ideas
4. **Break It Down**: Solve one small piece at a time
5. **Have Fun**: Randomness makes every run different!

## 🐛 Debugging Checklist

If your random numbers aren't working:
- [ ] Did you use `Math.floor()` for integers?
- [ ] Did you add `+ 1` for ranges starting at 1?
- [ ] Is your max - min + 1 calculation correct?
- [ ] Are you using `array.length` for array indices?
- [ ] Did you test multiple times (randomness varies!)?

## 📚 Quick Reference

### Random 1-6 (Dice):
```javascript
Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1
```

### Random from Array:
```javascript
let item = array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)];
```

### 50% Chance:
```javascript
if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
    // This runs 50% of the time
}
```
