# Final Draft Curriculum

This is the clean, second-pass curriculum build. We’ll refine each module and lesson using the original first draft as a reference, focusing on clarity, accessibility, and incremental learning.

Goals:
- Cohesive progression from HTML → CSS → JavaScript → Game Building
- Consistent formatting, styling, and assets across lessons
- Accessibility-first design (reduced motion, readable timing, captions)
- Clear practice, examples, resources, and answer keys in each lesson

Structure:
- `module-1-html/lessons/*`
- `module-2-css/lessons/*`
- `module-3-javascript/lessons/*`
- `module-4-game-building/lessons/*`

Next Steps:
- Populate `PLAN.md` with migration notes from the first draft
- Scaffold lesson templates per module
- Begin with Module 4 (final integration and polish), then iterate back through modules 1–3
