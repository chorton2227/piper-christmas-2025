# Exercise 1: Create Your Lists

## 🎯 Goal
Practice creating both unordered and ordered lists on a single page. You'll learn when to use each type and how to organize information effectively!

---

## 📋 Instructions

### Step 1: Create Your File
Create a new HTML file called `my-lists.html` in your student-workspace folder.

### Step 2: Set Up HTML Structure
Start with the basic template:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My Lists</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your lists go here! -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 3: Add a Main Heading
Add an `<h1>` tag with a title for your page (like "All About Me" or "My Favorite Things").

### Step 4: Create Your First Unordered List
1. Add an `<h2>` heading describing what your list is about
2. Create a `<ul>` tag
3. Add at least 5 `<li>` items
4. Close the `</ul>` tag

### Step 5: Create Your First Ordered List
1. Add another `<h2>` heading
2. Create an `<ol>` tag
3. Add at least 5 `<li>` items where order matters
4. Close the `</ol>` tag

### Step 6: Add More Lists
Create at least one more list of each type (total: 2 unordered, 2 ordered minimum).

## 🌟 Bonus Challenges

Want to go further? Try these:

1. **Add More Lists:** Create 3+ of each type (6+ lists total)
2. **Use Formatting:** Add `<strong>`, `<em>`, or `<mark>` inside some list items
3. **Add Descriptions:** Write a paragraph before each list explaining it
4. **Use Dividers:** Add `<hr>` tags to separate different sections
5. **Make It Long:** Create a list with 10+ items
6. **Get Creative:** Make lists about unique topics

### Example with Formatting
```html
<h2>My Dream Vacation Spots</h2>
<p>These are the places I <em>really</em> want to visit someday!</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Japan</strong> - For the culture and food</li>
    <li><mark>Hawaii</mark> - Beautiful beaches!</li>
    <li><strong>Paris, France</strong> - See the Eiffel Tower</li>
</ol>
```

## 💭 Think About It

As you create your lists:
1. Which list type (ul or ol) did you use more? Why?
2. How does using headings help organize your lists?
3. Could any of your unordered lists work better as ordered lists, or vice versa?

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Problem:** My list items don't have bullet points or numbers  
**Solution:** Make sure each `<li>` is inside a `<ul>` or `<ol>` container.

**Problem:** My lists run together  
**Solution:** Check that you've closed each `</ul>` or `</ol>` before starting a new list.

**Problem:** Text shows outside the list  
**Solution:** All content should be inside `<li>` tags when in a list.
