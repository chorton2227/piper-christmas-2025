# Lesson 1.3 — Lists

Overview
Represent related items using unordered, ordered, and description lists. Learn nesting and when to choose each list type.

Objectives
- Use `<ul>` and `<ol>` appropriately (unordered vs ordered sequences).
- Create `<dl>` with `<dt>` terms and `<dd>` descriptions.
- Nest lists for subitems; avoid over-nesting for readability.

Time
- 45–60 minutes

Examples
- `examples/example-1-basic-lists.html`: basic `<ul>` and `<ol>`.
- `examples/example-2-real-world.html`: navigation and steps.
- `examples/example-3-nested-lists.html`: categories with subitems.
- `examples/example-4-formatted-lists.html`: styling hooks and semantics.
- `examples/example-5-description-lists.html`: glossary.

Practice
- `practice/exercise-1.md`: Grocery list (unordered) and steps (ordered).
- `practice/exercise-2.md`: Nested categories for hobbies.
- `practice/exercise-3.md`: Build a glossary using description lists.
