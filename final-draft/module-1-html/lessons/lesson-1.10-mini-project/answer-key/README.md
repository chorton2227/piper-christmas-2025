# Answer Key / Example Project 📁

For this mini-project lesson, **there isn't a traditional "answer key"** since every student creates their own unique website on their chosen topic!

## Your Project Is Unique! 🎨

Unlike previous lessons with specific exercises, this mini-project is **open-ended**:
- You choose your own topic
- You design your own pages
- You create your own content
- You make it uniquely yours!

## Need a Reference?

Check the **example-project/** folder to see a complete working example:
- Path: `../example-project/`
- Open `index.html` to see a finished multi-page website
- Review the source code to understand the structure
- Use it as a model, but make your project your own!

## Grading Focus

Your instructor will grade based on:
- ✅ Meeting all requirements (see checklist.md)
- ✅ Proper HTML structure and syntax
- ✅ Working links, images, and forms
- ✅ Creativity and effort
- ✅ Complete, polished content

## Remember

There's no single "correct answer" for this project. As long as you:
1. Meet all technical requirements
2. Use proper HTML
3. Create working, cohesive pages
4. Put in genuine effort

...you're doing it right! 🌟
