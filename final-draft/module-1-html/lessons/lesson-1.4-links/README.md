# Lesson 1.4 — Links

Overview
Connect pages and jump within pages using hyperlinks. Learn external vs internal links, anchors, and special links (email/phone) with accessible link text.

Objectives
- Create external links with safe attributes (`target="_blank"` + `rel="noopener"`).
- Link between local pages with relative paths.
- Use anchor links to jump to sections via `id`.
- Use `mailto:` and `tel:` links appropriately.
- Write descriptive link text (avoid “click here”).

Time
- 45–60 minutes

Examples
- `examples/example-1-external-links.html`: external link best practices.
- `examples/example-2-internal-links.html`: multi-page navigation (relative links).
- `examples/example-3-anchor-links.html`: in-page navigation with anchors and skip link.
- `examples/example-4-mailto-tel.html`: contact links for email and phone.
- `examples/example-5-accessible-text.html`: better link wording.
- `examples/HOW-TO-VIEW.md`: viewing files in a browser (generic paths).

Practice
- `practice/exercise-1.md`: Build two pages with working internal links.
- `practice/exercise-2.md`: Add an in-page table of contents with anchors.
- `practice/exercise-3.md`: Create contact links using `mailto:` and `tel:`.

Resources
- `resources/cheatsheet.md`: link patterns and attributes.
- `resources/parent-guide.md`: guidance and checks.

Assessment (Checklist)
- Descriptive link text (no vague “click here”).
- Safe external links (`rel="noopener"` when opening new tabs).
- Internal links use correct relative paths.
- Anchors jump to the right section.

Accessibility Notes
- Keep link text concise and meaningful.
- Provide skip links for long pages to jump to `#main`.
