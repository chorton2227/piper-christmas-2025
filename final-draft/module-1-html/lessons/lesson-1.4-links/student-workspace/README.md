### Creating Links
- **External links:** Always use `https://` and `target="_blank"`
- **Internal links:** Just use the filename (e.g., `about.html`)
- **Anchor links:** Add `id` to target, use `#id` in link
- **Email links:** Use `mailto:email@example.com`

### Testing Your Links
- Click every link to make sure it works!
- For anchor links, make sure they jump to the right place
- Check that external links open in new tabs
- Hover over links with tooltips to see if they appear

### Organizing Your Work
- Keep all files for Exercise 2 in this same folder
