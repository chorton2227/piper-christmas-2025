# Parent Guide — Lesson 1.1

Support Goals
- Encourage learners to explain what each tag does.
- Help them choose clear titles and headings.

How to Help
- Ask: What element best describes this content?
- Check: Do links have descriptive text? Do images have `alt`?

Troubleshooting
- If a page doesn’t open, ensure the file extension is `.html`.
- If an image doesn’t load, check the `src` path and try a placeholder image.
