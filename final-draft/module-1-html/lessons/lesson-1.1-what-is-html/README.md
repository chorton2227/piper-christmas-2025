# Lesson 1.1 — What Is HTML?

Overview
- Learn what HTML is and how it structures content on the web using elements, tags, and attributes.
- Build your first simple web page and view it in a browser.

Objectives
- Define element, tag, attribute, and document.
- Use basic elements: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<meta>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images.
- Create and open a simple HTML file locally on Windows.

Time
- 45–60 minutes (flexible)

Materials
- VS Code (or any text editor), a web browser.

Key Concepts
- Elements and tags: `<p> ... </p>` wrap content.
- Attributes modify elements: `<a href="...">`.
- Document structure: doctype → html → head → body.
- Semantics: choose elements that convey meaning.

Vocabulary
- Element, Tag, Attribute, Doctype, Head, Body, Semantic.

Activities
1) Explore elements: open examples and identify tags/attributes.
2) Build: create your first page in `student-workspace` and open it.
3) Reflect: what does each tag mean and why use it?

Examples
- `examples/example-1-simple-element.html`: a single heading.
- `examples/example-2-tags-and-attributes.html`: links and images with attributes.
- `examples/example-3-basic-page.html`: full-page skeleton with title and content.
- `examples/HOW-TO-VIEW.md`: how to open files in a browser on Windows.

Practice
- `practice/exercise-1.md`: Make a page with a heading and paragraph.
- `practice/exercise-2.md`: Add a link and an image with alt text.
- `practice/exercise-3.md`: Create a 2‑page mini‑site with navigation.

Resources
- `resources/cheatsheet.md`: common tags and attributes.
- `resources/parent-guide.md`: guidance for helpers.

Answer Key
- `answer-key/my-first-page.html`: sample solution for Exercise 1.
- `answer-key/welcome.html`: sample home page for Exercise 3.

Assessment (Checklist)
- Uses correct document structure and a meaningful title.
- Includes at least one heading and paragraph.
- If images are present, includes `alt` text.
- If links are present, they work and have clear text.

Accessibility Notes
- Prefer semantic elements and clear link text.
- Always add `alt` to images, describing purpose or content.
