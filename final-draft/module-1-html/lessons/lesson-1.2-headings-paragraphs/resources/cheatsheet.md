# Headings & Paragraphs Cheatsheet

Headings
- `<h1>`: Page or primary title (use once when possible)
- `<h2>`: Major section
- `<h3>`: Subsection beneath `<h2>`
- Continue nesting only when needed

Rules
- Do not skip levels for visual size.
- Keep headings concise.
- Use CSS for appearance, not incorrect heading levels.

Paragraphs
- `<p>` wraps a block of text.
- One idea per paragraph.
- Use lists for sequences, not multiple short paragraphs pretending to be structure.

Line Breaks
- `<br>` for minor breaks (addresses, poems); do not stack `<br>` for spacing.
