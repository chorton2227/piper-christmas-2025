# Lesson 1.2 — Headings & Paragraphs

Overview
Structure written content using a clear heading hierarchy and readable paragraphs.

Objectives
- Use headings `<h1>`–`<h6>` correctly (one `<h1>` per page context).
- Group related content with sections and meaningful subheadings.
- Write concise, scannable paragraphs (one idea per paragraph).
- Avoid heading misuse (styling text as a heading when it is not a section label).

Time
- 45–60 minutes

Key Concepts
- Hierarchy: Headings create an outline (like chapters → sections → subsections).
- Screen readers rely on heading order to navigate.
- Paragraphs convey ideas; headings summarize groups of paragraphs.

Common Mistakes
- Skipping levels (`<h1>` then `<h4>`).
- Using headings for styling, not structure.
- Extra `<br>` tags instead of paragraphs.

Examples
- `examples/example-1-heading-levels.html`: proper descending levels.
- `examples/example-2-good-structure.html`: nested sections with paragraphs.
- `examples/example-3-text-formatting.html`: inline emphasis vs headings.
- `examples/example-4-line-breaks.html`: difference between `<p>` and `<br>`.

Practice
- `practice/exercise-1.md`: Outline a blog post with proper headings.
- `practice/exercise-2.md`: Fix a broken heading hierarchy.
- `practice/exercise-3.md`: Convert misused headings into paragraphs and emphasis.

Assessment (Checklist)
- Single logical `<h1>`.
- No skipped heading levels.
- Paragraphs used for text blocks (not multiple `<br>`).
- Headings summarize following content.

Accessibility Notes
- Keep headings short and descriptive.
- Maintain logical order; avoid jumping levels for visual style.
