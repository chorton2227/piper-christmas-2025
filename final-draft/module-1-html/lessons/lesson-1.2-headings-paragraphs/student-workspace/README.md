# Student Workspace - Lesson 1.2

Welcome to your workspace for practicing headings and paragraphs!

---

## 📁 Files You'll Create

In this lesson, you'll create these HTML files:

1. **my-story.html** - A story using headings and paragraphs (Exercise 1)
2. **recipe.html** - A formatted recipe (Exercise 2)
3. **blog-post.html** - A complete blog post with heading hierarchy (Exercise 3)

---

## 🚀 How to Get Started

### Step 1: Create Your Files
For each exercise, create a new HTML file in this folder.

**In VS Code:**
- Right-click this folder
- Choose "New File"
- Type the filename (like `my-story.html`)

**Or use File Explorer:**
- Right-click in this folder
- Choose New → Text Document
- Rename it with the `.html` extension

### Step 2: Start with the Template
Every HTML file should start with this basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Your Page Title Here</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here! -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 3: Add Your Content
Add headings, paragraphs, and formatting inside the `<body>` section.

### Step 4: Save and View
1. **Save your file:** Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on Mac)
2. **Open in browser:** Double-click the HTML file in File Explorer
3. **See your changes:** Refresh the browser after saving changes

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Save often!** Press Ctrl+S every time you add something new
2. **Test frequently!** Refresh your browser to see your changes
3. **Check your tags!** Make sure every opening tag has a closing tag
4. **Keep it organized!** Indent your code so it's easy to read
5. **One h1 only!** Each page should have exactly one `<h1>` tag
6. **Don't skip levels!** Go h1 → h2 → h3, not h1 → h4

## 🔍 How to View Your HTML Files

### Method 1: Double-Click
Just double-click any `.html` file in File Explorer - it will open in your default browser.

### Method 2: Right-Click → Open With
Right-click the file and choose your preferred browser.

### Method 3: From Your Browser
Drag and drop the HTML file into an open browser window.

### Method 4: Live Server (if using VS Code)
1. Install the "Live Server" extension
2. Right-click your HTML file
3. Choose "Open with Live Server"
4. Changes appear automatically when you save!
