    <h1>Using Line Breaks</h1>
    
    <h2>Without Line Breaks</h2>
    <p>This is all one paragraph even though I'm typing on multiple lines in my code. HTML ignores those line breaks!</p>
    
    <h2>With Line Breaks</h2>
    <p>
        This is the first line<br>
        This is the second line<br>
        This is the third line<br>
        All in one paragraph!
    </p>
    
    <h2>Multiple Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>This is the first paragraph. It has its own space.</p>
    <p>This is the second paragraph. It's separated from the first.</p>
    <p>This is the third paragraph. Notice the spacing!</p>

    <h2>Real Example: A Poem</h2>
    <p>
        <em>
            Roses are red,<br>
            Violets are blue,<br>
            HTML is fun,<br>
            And so are you!
        </em>

    <h2>Using Horizontal Rules</h2>
    <p>Horizontal rules create dividing lines between sections.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>See? That line above separates these sections!</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>You can use as many as you want!</p>
