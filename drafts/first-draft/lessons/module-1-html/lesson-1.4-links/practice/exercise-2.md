# Exercise 2: Build a Multi-Page Website

## 🎯 Goal
Create a website with multiple pages connected by links.

## 📋 Instructions

1. Create **at least 3 HTML files**:
   - `index.html` (Home page)
   - `about.html` (About page)
   - `contact.html` (Contact page)
   - (Optional: more pages!)

2. Each page should have:
   - Navigation menu linking to all pages
   - Unique content for that page
   - Consistent navigation (same on every page)

3. Home page should include:
   - Welcome message
   - Brief intro to the site
   - Links to other pages

4. About page should include:
   - Information about yourself
   - Your interests or hobbies
   - Link back to home

5. Contact page should include:
   - Email link
   - Social media links (or placeholders)
   - Link back to home

## 🎯 Example Navigation (use on every page)

```html
<nav>
    <h3>Site Menu</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
```

## 📁 File Structure

```
your-folder/
├── index.html
├── about.html
└── contact.html
```

All files should be in the same folder to make linking easy!
