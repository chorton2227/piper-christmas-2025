# Student Workspace 🎨

This is YOUR workspace for building the HTML Mini-Project!

## 📁 Getting Started

### Step 1: Plan Your Project
Before you write any code:
1. Review the project ideas in `resources/project-ideas.md`
2. Complete the planning worksheet in `resources/planning-worksheet.md`
3. Get your plan approved by a parent or instructor

### Step 2: Organize Your Files
Create your project structure:
1. Create your HTML files here in this folder
2. Create an `images` folder for your images
3. Name your main page `index.html`
4. Name other pages descriptively (like `about.html`, `gallery.html`, etc.)

### Step 3: Build Your Project
Work through your project systematically:
1. Start with `index.html` - create the basic structure
2. Add navigation that will appear on all pages
3. Complete the content for your first page
4. Create your second page (copy navigation from first page)
5. Create your third page
6. Add any additional pages
7. Test everything!

### Step 4: Check Your Work
Before submitting:
1. Use the checklist in `resources/checklist.md`
2. Test all links
3. Verify all images display
4. Proofread all content
5. Ask someone to review your project

## 📝 Recommended File Structure

Your folder should look like this when complete:

```
student-workspace/
├── index.html           # Your home page
├── page2.html          # Your second page (name it appropriately)
├── page3.html          # Your third page (name it appropriately)
├── images/             # Folder for images
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.png
│   └── ...
└── README.md           # This file
```

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Starting Tips
- Don't try to do everything at once
- Build one page at a time
- Test frequently in your browser
- Save often (Ctrl+S)

### HTML Tips
- Use proper indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
- Close all your tags
- Use semantic elements when appropriate
- Add comments to explain complex sections

### Content Tips
- Write real content, not just "Lorem ipsum"
- Make sure text is appropriate and school-friendly
- Proofread for spelling and grammar
- Keep paragraphs to a reasonable length

### Image Tips
- Create an `images` folder
- Name files without spaces (use hyphens: `my-image.jpg`)
- Always add alt text
- Don't use huge image files

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Issues

**Links not working?**
- Check that filenames match exactly (including `.html`)
- Make sure the file exists in the same folder
- Use relative paths (just the filename, not the full path)

**Images not showing?**
- Check that the image file exists in the `images` folder
- Verify the filename matches exactly (including extension)
- Make sure path is correct: `images/filename.jpg`

**Form not doing anything?**
- That's normal! Forms need backend code to process
- For this project, the form just needs to exist and have proper structure

**Page looks messy?**
- HTML doesn't include styling—that's what CSS is for (Module 2!)
- Focus on structure and content for now

### Getting Unstuck
1. Look at the example project for reference
2. Review lesson READMEs for specific topics
3. Check the resources folder for guides
4. Ask a parent or instructor for help
5. Take a break and come back with fresh eyes
