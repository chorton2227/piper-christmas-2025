### Encourage Experimentation

- "Can we have two h1 tags?"
- Let her break things - that's how we learn!

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Nothing shows up when I open the file"
- Check file extension is `.html` not `.txt`
- Verify content is in `<body>` tag
- Make sure browser isn't cached (refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R)

### "My heading looks weird"
- Check closing tag is present
- Verify no typos in tag name
- Look for extra characters

### "I can't find the HTML in the website source"
- Try a simpler website (like google.com)
- Use Ctrl+F to search for "<h1"
- Show her where to look

### "I don't understand the other stuff in the HTML structure"
- That's okay! Say "We'll learn that in the next lesson"
- Focus just on the content in `<body>` for now
- Don't overwhelm with details yet
