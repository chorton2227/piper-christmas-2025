# Exercise 1: Your First Heading

## 🎯 Goal
Create your very first HTML file with a heading that says something about you!

## 📋 Instructions

1. Create a new file called `my-first-page.html`
2. Type this HTML code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello! My name is [YOUR NAME]</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

3. Replace `[YOUR NAME]` with your actual name
4. Save the file
5. Open it in your browser (double-click the file)

## ✅ Success Check

You should see:
- A big heading with your name
- The text should be larger than normal text
- The browser tab should say "My First Page"

## 🌟 Bonus Challenge

Can you add:
- An `<h2>` heading that says your age?
- An `<h2>` heading that says your favorite hobby?

Try it! Remember: `<h2>` makes a smaller heading than `<h1>`.

---

## 💭 Think About It

- What happens if you forget the closing tag `</h1>`?
- What if you use `<h1>` for your name and `<h6>` for your hobby? How do they look different?
- Can you have two `<h1>` tags on the same page?

Try these experiments! The best way to learn is by trying things!
