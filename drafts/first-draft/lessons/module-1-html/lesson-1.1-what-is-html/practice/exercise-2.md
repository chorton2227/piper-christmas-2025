# Exercise 2: Exploring Web Pages

## 🎯 Goal
Explore real websites and see their HTML code!

## 📋 Instructions

### Part 1: Visit Websites
1. Open your favorite website (YouTube, Google, a game site, etc.)
2. Right-click anywhere on the page
3. Click "View Page Source" or "Inspect"
4. Look at the HTML code!

### Part 2: Scavenger Hunt
Can you find these HTML tags in the source code? Check them off when you find them!

- [ ] `<h1>` - A big heading
- [ ] `<p>` - A paragraph
- [ ] `<img>` - An image (we'll learn this soon!)
- [ ] `<a>` - A link (we'll learn this too!)
- [ ] `<div>` - A container (very common!)

### Part 3: Write It Down
In a text file or on paper, write down:
1. What website did you visit?
2. How many `<h1>` tags did you find?
3. What was one thing you saw in the code that you didn't understand? (That's okay! We'll learn it!)

## ✅ Success Check

You should:
- Have visited at least 1-2 websites
- Found some HTML tags
- Written down your observations

## 🌟 Bonus Challenge

Try these websites and see their HTML:
- google.com (very simple and clean)
- wikipedia.org (lots of text and headings)
- youtube.com (complex and interactive)

Which one has the most HTML code? Which is easiest to read?
