    <title>Styling with Spans</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Highlighting Text with Spans</h1>
    
    <h2>Example 1: Emphasizing Specific Words</h2>
    <p>
        My <span>favorite</span> game is <span>Minecraft</span> because 
        it lets me build <span>amazing</span> structures!
    </p>
    <p><em>Later with CSS, we could make those span words a different color!</em></p>
    
    <h2>Example 2: Game Stats</h2>
    <p>
        Player: <span>CoolGamer123</span><br>
        Score: <span>8,450</span> points<br>
        Level: <span>27</span><br>
        Status: <span>Online</span>
    </p>
    <p><em>Each stat value is in a span so we can style them later!</em></p>
    
    <h2>Example 3: Color Names</h2>
    <p>
        The rainbow has many colors: 
        <span>red</span>, 
        <span>orange</span>, 
        <span>yellow</span>, 
        <span>green</span>, 
        <span>blue</span>, 
        <span>indigo</span>, and 
        <span>violet</span>.
    </p>
    <p><em>With CSS, we could make each color word actually appear in that color!</em></p>
    
    <h2>Example 4: Important Information</h2>
    <p>
        The game starts at <span>3:00 PM</span> on <span>Saturday</span>. 
        Don't forget to bring your <span>controller</span> and <span>headset</span>!
    </p>
    
    <h2>Example 5: Labels and Values</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            <span>Username:</span> <span>Player007</span><br>
            <span>Email:</span> <span>player@example.com</span><br>
            <span>Member Since:</span> <span>2024</span><br>
            <span>Games Played:</span> <span>1,234</span>
        </p>
    </div>
    <p><em>We could use CSS to make labels bold and values a different color!</em></p>
    
    <h2>Example 6: Mixed Usage</h2>
    <p>
        In <span>2025</span>, the most popular games included 
        <span>Minecraft</span> with <span>200 million</span> players, 
        <span>Fortnite</span> with <span>400 million</span> players, 
        and <span>Roblox</span> with <span>70 million</span> daily active users.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Example 7: Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
    <p>
        Press <span>CTRL</span> + <span>S</span> to save your work.<br>
        Press <span>CTRL</span> + <span>Z</span> to undo.<br>
        Press <span>CTRL</span> + <span>C</span> to copy.<br>
        Press <span>CTRL</span> + <span>V</span> to paste.
    </p>
    <p><em>With CSS, we could make the keys look like actual keyboard buttons!</em></p>
    
    <h2>Example 8: Correct vs Incorrect Answers</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Question: What is 2 + 2?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>3</span> - Incorrect</li>
            <li><span>4</span> - Correct!</li>
            <li><span>5</span> - Incorrect</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p><em>We could make correct answers green and incorrect answers red with CSS!</em></p>

    <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Right now spans might seem pointless since they don't change the appearance. But they're SUPER useful for CSS styling! We're preparing our HTML structure for beautiful styling later.</p>
