# Exercise 2: Format a Recipe

## 🎯 Goal
Practice text formatting by creating a recipe page.

## 📋 Instructions

1. Create a new file called `recipe.html`
2. Choose your favorite recipe (or make one up!)
3. Format it using HTML with:
   - `<h1>` for the recipe name
   - `<h2>` for "Ingredients" section
   - `<h2>` for "Instructions" section
   - `<strong>` for important words
   - `<em>` for emphasis
   - `<br>` for line breaks in the ingredient list
   - Other formatting as needed

### Example Structure:
```
H1: Chocolate Chip Cookies
  H2: Description
    Paragraph about the recipe
  H2: Ingredients
    Paragraph with ingredients (use <br> between each)
  H2: Instructions
    Multiple paragraphs, one for each step
  H2: Tips
    Helpful hints
```

## ✅ Success Check

Your recipe should have:
- [ ] `<h1>` recipe title
- [ ] `<h2>` for each main section
- [ ] Ingredients listed with `<br>` between them
- [ ] Instructions in separate paragraphs
- [ ] Important words in `<strong>` (like "Preheat oven" or "Don't overmix")
- [ ] Optional items or notes in `<em>` italics
- [ ] At least one `<hr>` divider
- [ ] Proper HTML structure

## 🌟 Bonus Challenge

- Add a `<h2>` section for "Cooking Time" with details
- Use `<mark>` to highlight allergens (eggs, nuts, etc.)
- Add a "Notes" section with personal tips
- Use `<small>` for serving size information
- Include a quote about why you love this recipe
- Add multiple recipe variations with `<h3>` subsections

## 💡 Recipe Formatting Examples

### Ingredients with Line Breaks:
```html
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Dry Ingredients:</strong><br>
    2 cups flour<br>
    1 tsp baking soda<br>
    1/2 tsp salt<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Wet Ingredients:</strong><br>
    1 cup butter<br>
    3/4 cup sugar<br>
    2 eggs
</p>
```

### Instructions with Emphasis:
```html
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat your oven to <mark>350°F</mark>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mix the dry ingredients. <em>Don't overmix!</em></p>
```
