This folder contains the solution files for the Lesson 1.5 practice exercises.

## Exercise Solutions

### Exercise 1: my-gallery.html
A simple image gallery organized into three categories (Nature, Animals, Food) with 9 images total. Each category uses a heading, and all images include descriptive alt text.

**Key Features:**
- Three category sections with h2 headings
- Three images per category
- Descriptive alt text for accessibility
- Varied placeholder colors matching the content theme

### Exercise 2: my-pet.html
A pet showcase page featuring "Luna the Cat" with multiple images using the figure/figcaption pattern.

**Key Features:**
- Large featured image at the top with figure/figcaption
- About section with descriptive text
- Photo gallery with three captioned images
- Fun facts list
- Consistent use of width="400" or width="600" for sizing
- Descriptive captions that add context to images

### Exercise 3: index.html
A complete personal homepage incorporating all image techniques learned in the lesson.

**Key Features:**
- Large banner image at the top (800px wide)
- Profile photo in the About section (300px)
- Three hobby sections (Gaming, Art, Music), each with:
  - Captioned image using figure/figcaption
  - Descriptive paragraph
- Photo gallery section with 3 thumbnail images
- Closing banner image with caption
- All images have meaningful alt text
- Mix of different image sizes for visual variety

## Teaching Notes

These solutions demonstrate:
1. **Basic img syntax** - src, alt, width attributes
2. **Figure/figcaption** - Adding context to images
3. **Image sizing** - Using width attribute appropriately
4. **Alt text** - Descriptive, meaningful descriptions
5. **Visual organization** - Using images to structure content
6. **Real-world application** - Authentic use cases (gallery, profile, homepage)

## Common Student Mistakes to Watch For

1. **Missing alt text** - Remind students this is for accessibility
2. **Empty or generic alt text** - "image" or "photo" isn't helpful
3. **Forgetting closing tags** - img is self-closing, but figure needs </figure>
4. **Wrong attribute order** - Doesn't matter functionally, but consistency helps
5. **Not using figure/figcaption** - They might only use img when captions are needed

## Extension Ideas

If students finish early or want extra challenge:
- Add more images to the galleries
- Create links between the three pages
- Experiment with different image sizes
- Add a navigation menu to connect the pages
- Create additional sections with different image layouts
