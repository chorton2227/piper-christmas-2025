# Exercise 3: External JavaScript Adventure 📁

## 🎯 Goal
Create an HTML page with an EXTERNAL JavaScript file that tells a story or shares information!

## 📋 Instructions

### Step 1: Create Two Files
You'll need to create TWO separate files:
1. `adventure.html` - The HTML page
2. `adventure.js` - The JavaScript file

### Step 2: Build the HTML (adventure.html)
Create an HTML page with:
- Proper HTML structure
- A title like "My JavaScript Adventure"
- A heading explaining what the page does
- Instructions to open the console
- Optional: Add CSS styling to make it pretty
- A `<script>` tag that links to `adventure.js`
  - **Important:** Put this at the END of the body!
  - Use: `<script src="adventure.js"></script>`

### Step 3: Write the JavaScript (adventure.js)
In your `.js` file, create content using `console.log()`. Choose ONE of these themes:

#### Option A: Tell a Story
Write a short adventure story with:
- At least 3 chapters
- A main character
- A problem to solve
- Use math in the story (counts, calculations, etc.)
- An ending

#### Option B: Create a Game Guide
Make a guide for a real or imaginary game with:
- Game rules
- Scoring system (with calculations)
- Tips and strategies
- Example scenarios with math

#### Option C: Build a Fact Sheet
Create an interesting fact sheet about:
- A topic you love (animals, space, sports, etc.)
- At least 10 facts
- Include calculations (sizes, speeds, distances, etc.)
- Fun comparisons

## 💡 Tips
- Make sure both files are in the SAME folder
- Check the filename in your script tag matches exactly
- Test that it works by opening the HTML file
- Use lots of console.log() statements
- Format your output with spacing and headers
- Add comments to explain your code

## ✅ Requirements Checklist
- [ ] Two separate files (HTML and JS)
- [ ] HTML properly links to JavaScript file
- [ ] Script tag is at the END of the body
- [ ] JavaScript file has at least 15 console.log() statements
- [ ] At least 3 math calculations included
- [ ] Content is organized with headers/sections
- [ ] Both files have comments
- [ ] Output is formatted and easy to read
- [ ] Story/guide/facts are complete and make sense

## 🎯 Example JavaScript Structure
```javascript
// adventure.js
// My Awesome JavaScript Adventure

console.log('======================');
console.log('  ADVENTURE TITLE');
console.log('======================');
console.log('');

// Chapter 1
console.log('Chapter 1: The Beginning');
console.log('------------------------');
// Your story here...

// More chapters...

console.log('THE END');
```

## 🚀 Challenge (Optional)
- Add ASCII art to your output
- Create interactive choices (just display them)
- Include a progress bar: [████░░░░] 50%
- Add sound effect descriptions: "BOOM! 💥"
- Calculate statistics (like total score possible)
- Create a table of information using spaces

## 📝 What You'll Learn
- Creating and linking external JavaScript files
- Organizing code in separate files
- Professional JavaScript structure
- Creating formatted, readable output
- Building longer, more complex programs

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Forgetting the `.js` file extension
- ❌ Spelling the filename wrong in script tag
- ❌ Putting script tag in the wrong place
- ❌ Files not in the same folder
- ❌ Forgetting quotes around strings

Have fun creating something awesome! 🌟
