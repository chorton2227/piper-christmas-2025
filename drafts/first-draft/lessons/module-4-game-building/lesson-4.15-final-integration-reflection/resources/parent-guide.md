# Parent Guide – Lesson 4.15 (Final Integration & Reflection)

## Purpose
This final lesson helps students consolidate everything they built, prepare the game for sharing, and reflect on their learning journey.

## Learning Objectives
- Integrate multiple subsystems cleanly (logic, UI, audio, tutorial, testing)
- Perform accessibility and performance checks
- Produce release documentation & future roadmap
- Engage in meaningful self-reflection

## Conversation Prompts
1. What feature improved player experience the most?
2. How did adding tests change confidence in making changes?
3. Which bug fix was the most satisfying?
4. What would you prioritize for version 2.0?

## Vocabulary
- Bundle: Final packaged set of files for deployment
- Roadmap: Planned future improvements
- SemVer: Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Reflection: Intentional review of progress and learning

## Watch For
- Students forgetting to remove test harness from production
- Missing accessibility checks (dialog ARIA attributes)
- Unclear release notes (lacking future ideas)
- Reflection that's only praise (encourage honest critique)

## Support Tips
- Provide checklist for packaging tasks
- Encourage running through game using only keyboard
- Suggest reading release notes out loud for clarity

## Extension Ideas
- Public changelog file tracking versions
- Performance metric recording (load time, bundle size)
- Deploy to two hosts (GitHub Pages + local server) and compare behavior

## Reflection Prompts
"Which design decision would you revisit and why?" or "How did learning debugging strategies affect your approach to new problems?"

Celebrate the completion—this is a major milestone.
