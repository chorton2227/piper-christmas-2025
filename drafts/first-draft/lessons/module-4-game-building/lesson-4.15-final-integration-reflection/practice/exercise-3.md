# Exercise 3 – Release Notes & Reflection

## Objective
Create `RELEASE_NOTES.md` & `REFLECTION.md` documenting the project status and personal learning.

## Requirements
- Release notes: version tag, features, quality metrics, known limitations, future roadmap
- Reflection: what you learned, challenges, proud moments, improvement targets
- Use clear headings

## Steps
1. Draft bullet list of major features
2. Summarize test counts & bug log status
3. Identify at least 3 future improvements
4. Reflection: answer prompts (hardest feature, key debugging breakthrough, next goals)

## Release Notes Template
```md
