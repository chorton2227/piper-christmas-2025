## 🎯 Quick Recognition Guide

### How to Quickly Identify Hands:

**Step 1: Check for Flush**
- Are all 5 cards the same suit?
- YES → Flush (or better if also straight)
- NO → Continue

**Step 2: Check for Straight**
- Sort cards by rank
- Are they 5 in a row?
- YES → Straight (or straight flush if also flush!)
- NO → Continue

**Step 3: Count Matching Ranks**

**Group cards by rank**:
```
Example: 7♥ 7♠ 7♦ 3♣ 3♠

7 appears: 3 times
3 appears: 2 times
```

**What you find**:
- **4 matching** → Four of a Kind
- **3 matching + 2 matching** → Full House
- **3 matching** → Three of a Kind
- **2 matching + 2 matching** → Two Pair
- **2 matching** → One Pair
- **No matches** → High Card

## ⚔️ Comparing Same Hand Types

When both players have the same hand type, use these tiebreakers:

### One Pair
**Higher pair wins**
- Pair of Kings beats Pair of 5s
- If same pair, highest other card ("kicker") wins

### Two Pair
**Highest pair wins first**
- J-J-6-6-K beats 9-9-8-8-A (Jacks higher than 9s)
- If highest pair ties, compare second pair
- If both pairs tie, kicker decides

### Three of a Kind
**Higher three wins**
- Three 8s beats Three 4s

### Straight
**Highest card in straight wins**
- 9-8-7-6-5 beats 6-5-4-3-2
- Special: A-2-3-4-5 is LOWEST straight (Ace counts low)

### Flush
**Highest card wins**
- A♥ flush beats K♦ flush
- If highest card ties, compare next highest, etc.

### Full House
**Higher three wins**
- 8-8-8-3-3 beats 7-7-7-A-A (8s higher than 7s)

### Four of a Kind
**Higher four wins**
- Four 5s beats Four 2s

### Straight Flush
**Highest card wins**
- J♠ straight flush beats 9♣ straight flush

### Royal Flush
**Always ties!**
- All royal flushes are equal (extremely rare)
