# Parent Guide: Lesson 4.2 - Planning the Poker Game

**For Parents/Guardians helping students with game planning**

---

## 📋 Lesson Overview

**Lesson 4.2: Planning the Poker Game**  
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes  
**Type**: Design and Planning (No coding yet)

### What Your Child Will Do:
- Create a complete game design document
- Define exact game rules and features
- Sketch wireframes (UI layouts) for all screens
- Plan data structures and functions
- Write pseudocode for key logic
- Create a development timeline

### Why This Matters:
**Planning prevents problems!** Professional developers spend significant time planning before writing code. This lesson teaches:
- Breaking big projects into manageable pieces
- Thinking through logic before implementation
- Anticipating problems early
- Creating a roadmap to follow

**Your child is learning project management skills that apply to ANY big task, not just coding.**

## 🤝 How to Help

### Before the Lesson (10 minutes)

**1. Gather Materials:**
- Paper (blank or graph paper)
- Pencils, colored pencils/markers
- Ruler (helpful for wireframes)
- Notebook or binder for design doc
- Computer (optional - for typing design doc)

**2. Set the Stage:**
- Find a quiet workspace
- Clear table/desk
- Have Lesson 4.1 materials available (hand rankings, etc.)
- Minimize distractions

**3. Review Poker Knowledge:**
- Quick quiz: "Name 3 hand types"
- Ensure they remember game flow from Lesson 4.1
- If shaky, review before planning

---

### During the Lesson (60-90 minutes)

**Phase 1: Game Design Document (30 mins)**

**Your role:**
- Help brainstorm game title
- Discuss which features are essential vs nice-to-have
- Ask clarifying questions: "How will betting work?" "What if there's a tie?"
- Guide them to realistic scope (don't plan too much!)

**Key question to ask:** "Can you build a simple version FIRST, then add cool features later?"

**Red flag:** Child planning too many features (animations, sounds, multiple difficulty levels all at once)  
**Solution:** "Let's focus on getting the basics working first. You can add those later!"

---

**Phase 2: Wireframes (30 mins)**

**Your role:**
- Help them sketch the 3 main screens
- Encourage neatness (ruler for straight lines)
- Ask: "Where does everything go?"
- Suggest they label everything clearly

**Wireframing tips:**
- Start with boxes and labels (not detailed art)
- Think about what players see first
- Make important buttons BIG
- Leave space between elements (not cramped)

**Try this together:** Take turns sketching a screen each, compare notes

---

**Phase 3: Technical Planning (20 mins)**

**Your role:**
- Help them list what data to track
- "What information does the game need to remember?" (chips, cards, pot, etc.)
- Don't worry if you're not technical - ask them to explain their thinking
- Writing pseudocode together (in plain English)

**Example conversation:**
- Parent: "How will the game know who wins?"
- Child: "It compares the hands"
- Parent: "How does it compare them?"
- Child: "It checks what type each hand is, then picks the better one"
- Parent: "Great! Write that down as steps."

---

**Phase 4: Timeline (10 mins)**

**Your role:**
- Help set realistic expectations
- Consider their schedule (school, activities)
- Break project into weekly goals
- Make it feel achievable, not overwhelming

**Reality check questions:**
- "How much time can you spend on this per week?"
- "What else is happening (tests, sports, etc.)?"
- "Is 3 weeks enough? Or should we plan for 4?"

---

### After the Lesson

**1. Review Together:**
- Have them explain their design doc to you
- Ask questions to test understanding
- Celebrate their planning work!

**2. Post It:**
- Hang wireframes on wall near computer
- Keep design doc accessible
- They'll reference it constantly while coding

**3. Set Next Steps:**
- Schedule when they'll start Lesson 4.3 (HTML)
- Mark milestone dates on calendar
- Create accountability checkpoints

---

## 📚 Key Concepts to Reinforce

### 1. MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

**Explain:** "MVP means the simplest version that works"

**Example:** 
- MVP poker game: Cards, betting, winner detection
- NOT MVP: Animations, sounds, achievements (add later!)

**Why it matters:** Finishing something simple is better than abandoning something complex

**Help them identify:** "Which 5 features are REQUIRED for the game to work at all?"

---

### 2. Wireframes

**Explain:** "Wireframes are like blueprints for a house - they show the layout before building"

**Key principles:**
- Simple boxes and labels (not art)
- Shows WHERE things go
- Plans before coding
- Catches problems early

**Activity together:** Sketch a simple screen (like a login page) to practice

---

### 3. Data Structures

**Explain:** "Data structures are how you organize information in code"

**Real-world analogy:**
- "Like organizing your room: clothes in dresser, books on shelf, toys in bin"
- "In code: player info in one object, cards in an array, etc."

**Help them think:** "What does your game need to remember?"
- Chips (numbers)
- Cards (list of objects)
- Who's turn it is (text)
- etc.

---

### 4. Pseudocode

**Explain:** "Pseudocode is writing out logic in plain English before real code"

**Why useful:**
- Think through logic first
- Easier to spot problems
- Not tied to any programming language

**Practice together:** Write pseudocode for a simple task
```
HOW TO MAKE A SANDWICH:
  GET bread
  GET peanut butter
  GET jelly
  SPREAD peanut butter on one slice
  SPREAD jelly on other slice
  PUT slices together
  EAT sandwich
```

**Then try:** "How would you shuffle a deck of cards?" (in plain English)

---

## ❓ Common Questions & Answers

### Q: "How detailed should the plan be?"

**A:** Detailed enough to:
- Know what you're building
- Have a clear roadmap
- Anticipate major challenges

**Not so detailed that:**
- Planning takes longer than coding
- You get paralysis by analysis
- You can't adapt/change as you go

**Rule of thumb:** If they can explain the plan to you clearly, it's detailed enough.

---

### Q: "My child wants to add SO many features. Should I discourage them?"

**A:** Encourage their enthusiasm, but teach prioritization:

**Do this:**
- "That's an awesome idea! Let's write it down."
- "Which features are MUST-HAVE vs nice-to-have?"
- "Let's get the basics working, THEN add the cool stuff."
- Make a "Future Features" list for post-MVP

**Don't do this:**
- "That's too complicated" (discouraging)
- Let them plan too much (recipe for giving up)

**Sweet spot:** Clear MVP + ranked list of features to add later

---

### Q: "We're not programmers. How can I help with technical planning?"

**A:** You don't need to code to help!

**You CAN help with:**
- Organizing thoughts ("What do you need to track?")
- Breaking big problems into small pieces
- Drawing diagrams
- Asking clarifying questions
- Keeping them focused
- Celebrating progress

**You DON'T need to:**
- Understand JavaScript syntax
- Know algorithms
- Write code yourself
- Have all the answers

**Your job:** Guide thinking, not provide technical solutions

---

### Q: "How do I know if their timeline is realistic?"

**A:** Use this formula:

```
[Planned hours] × 1.5 = Actual time needed
```

**Why?** First projects always take longer than expected (debugging, learning, distractions)

**Example:**
- Child estimates: 20 hours
- Reality: 30+ hours
- If they have 2 hours/week: Plan for 15 weeks, not 10

**Better to:** Under-promise and finish early than over-promise and give up

---

### Q: "They're overwhelmed by how much there is to plan. Help!"

**A:** Break it down:

**Day 1:** Just write game rules  
**Day 2:** Just list features  
**Day 3:** Just sketch screens  
**Day 4:** Just list functions needed  
**Day 5:** Put it all together

**Don't try to:** Complete entire design doc in one sitting

**Remember:** Planning can be done over several days. It's not a race!

## 🚩 Red Flags & Solutions

### Red Flag 1: "I don't know what to include"
**Signs:** Blank page syndrome, staring at template

**Help:**
- Start with questions: "What happens when game starts?"
- Walk through game mentally: "Then what happens?"
- Look at professional games for inspiration
- Reference Lesson 4.1 examples

### Red Flag 2: Planning too much
**Signs:** 50+ features listed, overly detailed specs

**Help:**
- "Let's focus on the top 10 most important features"
- "Which features make it playable vs nice-to-have?"
- Create MVP vs "Version 2" lists
- Remind them: Can always add more later!

### Red Flag 3: Wireframes are too vague
**Signs:** Messy sketches, unlabeled boxes, unclear layout

**Help:**
- "What is this box?" (label everything!)
- "How big should this be?"
- Redraw together on fresh paper
- Use ruler for cleaner lines

### Red Flag 4: Skipping hard questions
**Signs:** "I'll figure it out later", avoiding edge cases

**Help:**
- "What happens if both players have the same hand?"
- "What if player has 0 chips?"
- "How does dealer decide what to do?"
- Write down questions to answer (don't leave blank)

### Red Flag 5: Unrealistic timeline
**Signs:** "I'll finish in 3 days!", rushing through planning

**Help:**
- Show them Module 4 has 15 lessons (it's meant to take weeks!)
- Explain: Quality takes time
- Better to go slow and succeed than rush and quit
- Build in buffer time for problems

## 💡 Teaching Tips

### Make it Visual
- Use different colored pens for different screens
- Post wireframes on wall
- Draw diagrams and flowcharts
- Use sticky notes for features (can move them around)

### Use Analogies
- "Game design doc is like a recipe - it tells you what to make and how"
- "Wireframes are like blueprints for a house"
- "MVP is like a bicycle - gets you there, even if you want a car later"
- "Pseudocode is like written directions before a road trip"

### Encourage Iteration
- "First draft doesn't need to be perfect"
- "Plans can change as you learn"
- "Even professionals revise their plans"
- Show them your own planning (work project, vacation, etc.)

### Connect to Their Experience
- "Remember building with LEGOs? You looked at the picture first, right?"
- "When you write an essay, do you outline first?"
- "Planning is like studying for a test - helps you succeed"
