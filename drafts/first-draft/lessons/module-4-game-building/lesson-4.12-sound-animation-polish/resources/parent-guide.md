# Parent / Instructor Guide – Lesson 4.12 Sound & Animation

## Purpose
Reinforce that polish serves clarity. Students learn to map game events to concise sensory feedback.

## Discussion Prompts
| Topic | Prompt |
|-------|-------|
| Feedback | "Which animation actually helped you understand the event?" |
| Accessibility | "How would you adapt for someone sensitive to flashing?" |
| Restraint | "What feels like too much?" |

## Suggested Flow (60 min)
1. Introduce audio/animation principles – 5 min
2. Implement audio manager – 10 min
3. Card deal animation – 15 min
4. Chip travel & overlay – 15 min
5. Reduced motion & mute controls – 10 min
6. Share & reflect – 5 min

## Support Tips
Issue | Strategy
----- | --------
Animations choppy | Remove heavy box-shadows; use transform
Audio not playing | Browser blocked: ensure first user click unlocks
Pitch sounds odd | Keep `playbackRate` within 0.9–1.1

## Encouragement Language
"Great—that animation draws attention without shouting."  
"Thoughtful accessibility toggle shows empathy for players."  

## Extension
- Theme selector swaps audio & CSS classes
- Achievement sound variations by rarity

Keep focus on player clarity over spectacle.
