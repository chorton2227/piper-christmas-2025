# Exercise 1: Color Names Practice

## 🎯 Goal
Practice using CSS color names to style different elements.

## 📝 Instructions

1. **Open your student workspace folder** and create a new file called `color-names.html`

2. **Create an HTML page** with the following content:
   - A header with a title "My Favorite Colors"
   - Three paragraphs, each describing a different color you like
   - A list of at least 5 colors

3. **Style your page** using CSS color names:
   - Make the page background `lightcyan` or `lavender`
   - Make the header background a color of your choice
   - Make the header text white
   - Give each paragraph a different text color (red, blue, green, purple, etc.)
   - Make the list items different colors - get creative!

4. **Add some extra styling** (optional but fun!):
   - Add padding to your header
   - Make text bigger or smaller
   - Try different background colors on your paragraphs

## 💡 Hints

- Use the `<style>` tag in your HTML `<head>` for your CSS
- Remember the format: `color: red;` or `background-color: lightblue;`
- You can use any of the 140+ color names HTML supports!
- Common colors: red, blue, green, yellow, orange, purple, pink, brown, black, white
- Light colors: lightblue, lightgreen, lightpink, lightcoral
- Dark colors: darkblue, darkgreen, darkred
