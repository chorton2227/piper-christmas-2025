# Student Workspace - Lesson 2.1

## 👋 Welcome!

This is your workspace for Lesson 2.1: What is CSS?

You'll complete three exercises here to practice adding CSS to your HTML pages.

## 📁 What to Create

### Exercise 1: Inline Styles
Create a file called `my-styles.html` where you'll practice adding styles directly to HTML elements.

### Exercise 2: Internal CSS
Create a file called `favorite-things.html` where you'll organize your CSS in a `<style>` tag.

### Exercise 3: External CSS (Most Important!)
Create **TWO files**:
1. `about-me.html` - your HTML page
2. `about-me-styles.css` - your CSS stylesheet

**Important**: Both files must be in THIS folder (student-workspace) to work together!

## 📖 Instructions

1. Read the exercise instructions in the `practice` folder
2. Create your files here in the `student-workspace` folder
3. Work through each exercise at your own pace
4. Check your work in a web browser
5. Compare with answer keys if you get stuck (but try first!)

## 💡 Tips

- **Save often!** Use Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on Mac)
- **Test in browser**: Right-click your HTML file → Open with → Browser
- **Refresh browser**: Press F5 to see your changes
- **Be creative**: Make it YOUR style!
- **Ask for help**: Check the parent guide or cheatsheet if needed
