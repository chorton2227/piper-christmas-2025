                Hi! My name is Piper and I'm learning web development. It's so cool to be 
                able to create my own websites! I never knew that making colorful, 
                interactive pages could be this much fun. HTML gives the structure, and 
                CSS makes everything beautiful!

            <h2>Fun Facts About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I can solve a Rubik's cube in under 3 minutes! My favorite subject is 
                art because I love being creative. When I grow up, I want to become a 
                game developer or web designer so I can create amazing experiences for 
                people all around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also love animals - especially cats and dogs. My dream is to have a 
                pet cat someday. I enjoy learning new things every day, and coding is 
                one of the coolest skills I've ever learned!
