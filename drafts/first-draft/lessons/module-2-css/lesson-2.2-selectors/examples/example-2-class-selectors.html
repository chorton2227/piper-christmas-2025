    <h1>Class Selectors Demo</h1>
    
    <p>
        This is a regular paragraph with no class. It has the default paragraph styling.
    </p>
    
    <p class="highlight">
        This paragraph has the "highlight" class! Notice how it stands out with 
        a yellow background and bold text.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Another regular paragraph. See the difference between regular paragraphs 
        and those with the highlight class?
    </p>
    
    <p class="highlight">
        Classes can be used on multiple elements! This paragraph also has the 
        highlight class, so it looks the same as the other highlighted one.
