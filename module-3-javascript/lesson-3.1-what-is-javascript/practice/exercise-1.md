# Exercise 1: Your First JavaScript Message 👋

## 🎯 Goal
Create an HTML page with JavaScript that prints messages to the console about yourself!

## 📋 Instructions

### Step 1: Create Your HTML File
Create a file called `about-me.html`

### Step 2: Add Basic HTML Structure
Include:
- DOCTYPE and html tags
- head with title
- body with an h1 heading that says "About Me"
- A paragraph explaining to open the console

### Step 3: Add a Script Tag
At the end of the body (before `</body>`), add a `<script>` tag

### Step 4: Write JavaScript Code
Inside the script tag, use `console.log()` to print:

1. A greeting message (e.g., "Hello! My name is...")
2. Your age (use math if you want! Like `2025 - 2015`)
3. Your favorite color
4. Your favorite number
5. A math fact using your favorite number (e.g., "My favorite number doubled is...")
6. Three things you like to do

## 💡 Tips
- Remember to put text in quotes: `console.log('Hello')`
- You can combine text and numbers: `console.log('I am', 10, 'years old')`
- Use `console.log('')` to add empty lines for spacing
- Comments help explain your code: `// This is my greeting`

- [ ] Script tag at end of body
