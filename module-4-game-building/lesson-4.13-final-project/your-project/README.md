# Your Texas Hold'em Poker Project 🎮

## Getting Started

This is **your workspace** for building the complete poker game. Use the templates and guides here to create your own version!

## Quick Start

1. **Copy the starter template** from `starter-template.html`
2. **Follow the building checklist** in `building-checklist.md`
3. **Test as you go** using `testing-guide.md`
4. **Reference the complete game** when you get stuck

## Folder Structure

Create this structure for your project:

```

```

## Building Approach

### Option 1: Bottom-Up (Recommended for Beginners)
Start with the foundational pieces and build up:
1. Deck creation and shuffling
2. Card display
3. Hand evaluation
4. Game state
5. Betting system
6. AI logic
7. UI polish

### Option 2: Top-Down (For Experienced Coders)
Start with the big picture and fill in details:
1. Create HTML structure
2. Add placeholder functions
3. Implement each function
4. Connect everything together
5. Test and debug

### Option 3: Feature-by-Feature
Build one complete feature at a time:
1. Single-player vs 1 AI (basic)
2. Add more AI players
3. Add betting
4. Add advanced features
5. Polish and perfect

## Development Tips

### Before You Code
- [ ] Read through all the step-by-step guides
- [ ] Play the complete game to understand features
- [ ] Plan your approach
- [ ] Set up your file structure

### While Coding
- [ ] Write small functions that do one thing
- [ ] Test each function immediately
- [ ] Use console.log liberally
- [ ] Comment your code as you write
- [ ] Save frequently

### Testing
- [ ] Test normal cases
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Test error conditions
- [ ] Play the game yourself
- [ ] Have someone else play it

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Trying to build everything at once**
✅ Build incrementally, test each piece

❌ **Copying code without understanding it**
✅ Type it yourself, understand each line

❌ **Skipping testing until the end**
✅ Test constantly as you build

❌ **Getting discouraged by bugs**
✅ Bugs are normal - they're learning opportunities!

❌ **Not asking for help when stuck**
✅ Review lessons, check examples, ask questions

## Debugging Checklist

When something doesn't work:

1. **Check the console** (F12) for error messages
2. **Read the error** - it tells you the line and problem
3. **Add console.log** to see what values you have
4. **Compare to examples** - what's different?
5. **Simplify** - comment out code until it works
6. **Google it** - someone has probably had the same issue
7. **Take a break** - fresh eyes spot bugs faster
