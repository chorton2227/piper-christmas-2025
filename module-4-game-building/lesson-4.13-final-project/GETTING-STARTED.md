## Tips for Success

**1. Start with the Complete Game**
Play it, break it apart, understand it. The best way to learn is to see a working example.

**2. Build Incrementally**
Don't try to build everything at once. Get one phase working before moving to the next.

**3. Test Constantly**
After adding each feature, test it thoroughly. Fix bugs as they appear, not later.

**4. Use console.log**
Debug by logging values and seeing what's happening at each step.

**5. Don't Be Afraid to Experiment**
Try new features! Add your own ideas! Make mistakes and learn from them!
