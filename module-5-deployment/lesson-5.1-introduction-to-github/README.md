# Lesson 5.1: Introduction to GitHub

## What You'll Learn

In this lesson, you'll learn what GitHub is, why developers use it, and how to create your own free GitHub account.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain what GitHub is and what it's used for
- Create a free GitHub account

## What is GitHub?

**GitHub is like Google Drive for code.** It's a website where developers:
- Store their code
- Share projects with others
- Host websites for free
- Work on code together

### Why GitHub?

- **Free hosting** - GitHub Pages lets you host websites at no cost
- **Professional tool** - Used by millions of developers worldwide
- **Portfolio** - Show off your projects to colleges/employers
- **Backup** - Your code is safely stored in the cloud

### Real-World Use

- Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook use GitHub
- Open-source projects (like VS Code!) are hosted on GitHub
- Developers share code and collaborate globally

---

## Key GitHub Terms

Before we dive in, let's learn some important vocabulary:

### Repository (or "repo")
A **repository** is like a folder for your project. It contains all your files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and tracks changes to them.

**Example:** `poker-game` repository contains your Texas Hold'em game

### Commit
A **commit** is like saving a version of your project. Each commit is a snapshot of your files at a specific time.

**Example:** "Added betting feature" commit shows what changed when you added betting

### GitHub Pages
**GitHub Pages** is free website hosting from GitHub. It turns your repository into a live website.

**Example:** Your repo becomes `https://yourusername.github.io/poker-game`

**Real example:** [https://chorton2227.github.io/poker-game/](https://chorton2227.github.io/poker-game/)

### Clone/Upload
- **Clone** = Download a repository from GitHub to your computer
- **Upload/Push** = Send your files from computer to GitHub

## Creating Your GitHub Account

Let's set up your free GitHub account!

### Step 1: Go to GitHub

Open your web browser and go to: **https://github.com**

### Step 2: Click "Sign Up"

Look for the "Sign up" button in the top-right corner.

### Step 3: Choose a Username

**Important:** Your username will be part of your website URL!

**Good usernames:**
- `piper-dev` → `https://piper-dev.github.io/poker-game`
- `pipercodes` → `https://pipercodes.github.io/poker-game`
- `piper2025` → `https://piper2025.github.io/poker-game`
- `chorton2227` → `https://chorton2227.github.io/poker-game` ← Real working example!

**Tips:**
- Keep it professional (you might use this for job applications!)
- Make it memorable
- Avoid numbers if possible (unless birth year)
- Can't change it easily later, so choose wisely

### Step 4: Enter Email and Password

- Use an email you can access (you'll need to verify it)
- Choose a strong password
- Complete the verification puzzle

### Step 5: Verify Your Email

1. GitHub will send you an email
2. Open it and click the verification link
3. You'll be redirected back to GitHub

### Step 6: Choose Free Plan

GitHub will ask about your plan:
- Select **"Free"** (you don't need paid features)
- Answer optional questions or skip them

**Congratulations! You now have a GitHub account!** 🎉

## Understanding GitHub's Interface

Let's explore GitHub's main pages:

### Your Profile Page

Click your profile icon (top-right) → "Your profile"

You'll see:
- Your username and bio
- Repositories you've created
- Your contribution activity
- Projects you've starred

### The Dashboard

Click the GitHub logo (top-left) to return to your dashboard

You'll see:
- Recent activity
- Repositories you're watching
- Suggested projects

### Repositories Tab

Click "Repositories" in the top menu

This shows all your repositories (none yet, but soon!)

---

## What's Next?

In the next lesson, you'll:
1. Create your first repository for your poker game
2. Upload all your game files
3. Write a professional README

---

## Practice Exercise

Complete these tasks to solidify your understanding:

### Exercise 1: Explore GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/explore
2. Browse trending repositories
3. Click on a popular project
4. Look at its files and README
5. Notice how it's organized

**Questions to answer:**
- What do professional repositories have in common?
- How do developers write their README files?
- What file types do you see?

### Exercise 2: Plan Your Repository

Before we upload your game, let's plan:

1. **Choose a repository name** for your poker game
   - Examples: `poker-game`, `texas-holdem`, `holdem-poker`
   - Lowercase, use hyphens for spaces
   - Keep it short and descriptive

2. **Write down your GitHub username and repo name**
   - Your future URL will be: `https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]`
   - Example: `https://piper-dev.github.io/poker-game`
   - Real example: `https://chorton2227.github.io/poker-game`

3. **Draft a one-sentence description** of your game
   - This will appear on your repository
   - Example: "A fully-featured Texas Hold'em poker game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"

### Exercise 3: Set Up Your Profile (Optional)

Make your profile look professional:

1. Add a profile picture (optional but recommended)
2. Add a bio (e.g., "Student developer learning web development")
3. Add your location (optional)
4. Add a website link (you'll have one soon!)

## Need Help?

**Common Issues:**

**Q: I didn't get the verification email**
- Check your spam folder
- Click "Resend verification email" on GitHub
- Make sure you entered the correct email address

**Q: My username is taken**
- Try adding numbers (birth year)
- Try a variation (add "dev" or "codes")
- Use middle name or nickname

**Q: I want to change my username later**
- It's possible but complicates things
- Better to choose carefully now
- URLs with old username won't work

## Parent Note

GitHub is a professional platform appropriate for students. It's widely used in education and is a valuable skill for students interested in technology.

**What parents should know:**
- GitHub accounts are free and safe
- Student will upload code that's publicly visible
- Helps build a portfolio for college/career
- Used by schools worldwide for teaching coding

**Privacy tips:**
- Choose a professional username
- Don't include full name if privacy is a concern
- Don't upload personal information in code comments
- Can make repositories private (but defeats hosting purpose)
