# Parent Guide: Lesson 5.1 - Introduction to GitHub

## What Your Child is Learning

In this lesson, your child is learning about **GitHub**, a professional platform used by software developers worldwide. They'll create a free account and learn the basics of how GitHub works.

Think of GitHub as **"Google Drive for code"** - it's where developers store, share, and collaborate on projects.

---

## Why This Matters

GitHub is:

✅ **Industry standard** - Used by Google, Microsoft, Apple, and millions of developers  
✅ **Portfolio building** - Shows colleges/employers what they can create  
✅ **Free hosting** - Lets students publish websites at no cost  
✅ **Educational tool** - Widely used in computer science education  

Learning GitHub teaches:
- Professional developer practices
- Version control (tracking changes)
- Online collaboration
- Digital portfolio creation

## What to Discuss Before Starting

### 1. Choosing a Username

Your child's username will be **public and part of their website URL**.

**Discuss:**
- Think long-term (might use for college applications/jobs)
- Keep it professional (avoid silly names they'll outgrow)
- Consider using first name + "dev" or "codes"

**Examples:**
- ✅ `piper-dev`, `pipercodes`, `piper2025`
- ❌ `coolkid123`, `gamergirl`, `xXpiperXx`

**Note:** Usernames are hard to change later!

### 2. Public vs Private

**Important:** Code uploaded to GitHub is **publicly visible** by default.

**Discuss:**
- Anyone can see their poker game code
- This is GOOD - it's how portfolios work
- Don't put personal information in code comments
- Private repos are possible but defeat the hosting purpose

### 3. Email Verification

Creating a GitHub account requires an email address.

**You may need to:**
- Provide/supervise email access
- Help with verification email
- Check spam folder if email doesn't arrive

### 4. Online Presence

This is their first step in building a **professional online presence**.

**Talk about:**
- Appropriate profile pictures
- Professional bios
- What future employers/colleges might see
- Digital footprint awareness

## How to Help

### Setting Up the Account

**Be present for:**
1. Choosing the username (discuss together)
2. Email verification (they may need your help)
3. Profile setup (guide toward professional choices)

**If they get stuck:**
- "Verification email not received" → Check spam folder
- "Username taken" → Help brainstorm alternatives
- "What should my bio say?" → Keep it simple and professional

### Understanding GitHub

**Help them grasp the concepts:**

**Repository = Project Folder**
- "Just like a folder on your computer, but online"
- "Contains all files for one project"

**Commit = Save**
- "Like saving different versions of an essay"
- "You can go back to any saved version"

**GitHub Pages = Free Website**
- "GitHub will host your poker game for free"
- "It'll have a real web address anyone can visit"

### Encouraging Exploration

**Exercise 1** asks them to explore other projects.

**Support by:**
- Looking at GitHub projects together
- Discussing what makes a good README
- Asking "How would you explain your project?"

## Common Questions

### "Is GitHub safe for kids?"

**Yes.** GitHub is:
- Used in schools worldwide
- Appropriate for students learning to code
- No social features like messaging
- Focused purely on code/projects

**Safety tips:**
- Don't share personal information
- Use appropriate username
- Keep profile professional

### "Why not use something simpler?"

GitHub teaches **real-world skills**:

Other platforms don't offer the same professional value.

### "Can they delete their account later?"

Yes, GitHub accounts can be deleted anytime. However:
- Better to set it up right from the start
- Might want to keep it for future projects
- Could be useful for college/career portfolio

### "What if they make mistakes?"

**That's part of learning!**
- Repositories can be deleted
- Code can be updated
- Mistakes are how we learn
- Professional developers make mistakes too
