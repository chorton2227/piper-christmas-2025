# Exercise 2: Plan Your Repository

## Objective

Plan how you'll organize and describe your poker game repository on GitHub.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Choose Your Repository Name

Your repository name will be part of your URL: `https://yourusername.github.io/[repo-name]`

**Rules for repository names:**
- All lowercase
- No spaces (use hyphens `-` instead)
- Letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Should describe the project

**Good examples:**
- `poker-game`
- `texas-holdem`
- `holdem-poker`
- `poker-showdown`

**Bad examples:**
- `My Poker Game` (has spaces and capitals)
- `game123` (not descriptive)
- `final_project` (generic, underscores less common)
- `PokerGame` (capitals not conventional)

**Your repository name:** ___________________________

### Step 2: Write Your Repository Description

GitHub lets you add a short description (under 100 characters) that appears at the top of your repository.

**Good description formula:**
`[What it is] + [technology used] + [special feature]`

**Examples:**
- "A fully-featured Texas Hold'em poker game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"
- "Texas Hold'em poker game with AI opponents and realistic betting"
- "Browser-based poker game featuring Texas Hold'em rules and animations"

**Your description:** 

___________________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________________

### Step 3: Plan Your File Organization

Look at your current poker game files. List them below:

**HTML files:**
- ___________________________
- ___________________________

**CSS files:**
- ___________________________
- ___________________________

**JavaScript files:**
- ___________________________
- ___________________________
- ___________________________

**Other files (images, sounds, etc.):**
- ___________________________
- ___________________________
- ___________________________

### Step 4: Plan Your Folder Structure

How will you organize these files in your GitHub repository?

**Recommended structure:**
```
poker-game/
├── index.html          (main HTML file)
├── README.md           (project documentation)
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── js/
│   ├── game.js
│   └── modules/
│       ├── deck.js
│       ├── handEvaluator.js
│       └── ...other modules
├── assets/             (optional)
│   ├── images/
│   └── sounds/
```

**Your planned structure:**

Draw or write out how you'll organize your files:

```
[Your repository name]/
├── 
├── 
├── 
└── 
```

### Step 5: Write Your Future URL

Based on your username and repository name, write your future website URL:

**Your GitHub username:** ___________________________

**Your repository name:** ___________________________

**Your future URL:** 

`https://_______________________________.github.io/_______________________________`

## What You're Learning

This exercise teaches you:
- GitHub naming conventions
- How to write professional project descriptions
- How to organize files for public repositories
- Planning before executing (important developer skill)

## Success Criteria

✅ Chosen a repository name following conventions
✅ Written a clear, descriptive project description
✅ Listed all your poker game files
✅ Planned a clean folder structure
✅ Know your future website URL

## Bonus Challenge

⭐ Draft a few bullet points for your README (What features does your game have?)  
⭐ Think about what screenshot would best represent your game  

## Time Estimate

**15-20 minutes**

## Tips

💡 **Keep it simple** - Simple names and structures are easier to manage

💡 **Be consistent** - If you use hyphens in your repo name, use them in file names too

💡 **Think ahead** - Choose names you won't be embarrassed by later

## Next Steps

Once you've planned your repository, you're ready to move to **Lesson 5.2** where you'll actually create it and upload your files!
