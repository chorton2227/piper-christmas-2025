# Exercise 1: Explore GitHub

## Objective

Explore GitHub to see how professional developers organize their projects and write documentation.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Visit GitHub Explore

Go to: **https://github.com/explore**

This page shows trending repositories (popular projects).

### Step 2: Browse Projects

1. Look at the "Trending" section
2. Click on 2-3 repositories that look interesting
3. For each repository, examine:
   - The README file (scroll down on the main page)
   - The file structure (what files/folders exist)
   - How the project is described
   - Screenshots or demos (if any)

### Step 3: Answer These Questions

Write your answers in a text file or on paper:

1. **What do professional READMEs include?**
   - (Examples: description, how to use, screenshots, features list)

2. **How do developers name their files?**
   - (Examples: lowercase, hyphens vs underscores, organized in folders)

3. **What information is in the repository description?**
   - (The one-line description at the top)

4. **Do you see any patterns in project organization?**
   - (Examples: separate folders for CSS/JS, README always present)

### Step 4: Find a Game Project

Use GitHub's search bar to search for: **"html game"**

Find a simple HTML game project and answer:

1. What files does it have?
2. How is the README written?
3. Is there a live demo link?
4. How would you describe the project in one sentence?
