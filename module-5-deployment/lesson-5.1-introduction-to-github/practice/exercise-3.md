# Exercise 3: Set Up Your GitHub Profile (Optional)

## Objective

Personalize your GitHub profile to make it professional and presentable.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Profile

1. Log in to GitHub
2. Click your profile icon in the top-right
3. Click "Your profile"

You'll see your profile page with your username and join date.

### Step 2: Edit Your Profile

Click the **"Edit profile"** button.

### Step 3: Add Profile Information

Complete these optional fields:

#### Profile Picture
- Click on your current avatar
- Upload a photo or avatar image
- **Tips:**
  - Use a clear image
  - Professional or fun (your choice)
  - Square images work best
  - Many students use avatars/logos they created

#### Bio
Write a short bio (160 characters max)

**Examples:**
- "Student developer learning web development 🚀"
- "High school coder | Building games with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"
- "Learning to code one project at a time 💻"
- "Web development student | Texas Hold'em poker game creator"

**Your bio:** 

___________________________________________________________________

#### Company
- Optional field
- You could put your school name or leave blank
- Example: "Lincoln High School" or "Student"

#### Location
- Optional
- Can be as general as you want
- Examples: "USA", "California", "Sacramento, CA"

#### Website
- Leave blank for now
- After you deploy, you can add your poker game URL here!

#### Twitter
- Optional
- Only if you have a Twitter account and want to link it

### Step 4: Customize Your Profile Appearance

Scroll down to see more options:

#### Profile README (Advanced - Optional)
You can create a special repository that displays on your profile.

**For now:** Skip this - you can add it later after you've learned more!

#### Pinned Repositories
After you create your poker game repository, you can "pin" it to your profile to highlight it.

**For now:** Nothing to pin yet - we'll come back to this!

### Step 5: Save Your Changes

Click **"Save"** at the bottom of the page.

### Step 6: View Your Public Profile

Click "Overview" to see how your profile looks to others.

## What You're Learning

This exercise teaches you:
- Personal branding for developers
- Making a professional online presence
- How employers/colleges view GitHub profiles
- Customizing your developer identity

## Success Criteria

✅ Added a profile picture (optional but recommended)
✅ Written a bio that describes you as a developer
✅ Saved your profile changes
✅ Viewed your public profile

## Bonus Challenges

⭐ **Future task:** After deploying your poker game, add its URL to your profile website field

⭐ **Research:** Look at some professional developers' GitHub profiles for inspiration
   - Search for developers who work at companies you admire
   - See how they organize their profiles
   - Note what makes a profile look professional

⭐ **Plan ahead:** Think about what other projects you might want to showcase on GitHub in the future

## Time Estimate

**10-15 minutes**

## Tips

💡 **Be yourself** - Your profile should reflect your personality while being professional

💡 **Keep it updated** - As you build more projects, update your bio and pinned repos

💡 **Privacy** - You don't have to share personal information. Keep it general if you prefer.

💡 **First impressions matter** - Your GitHub profile might be viewed by colleges or employers someday!

## Examples of Good Student Profiles

**Good student bio examples:**
- ✅ "Student developer | Building web apps and games"
- ✅ "Learning JavaScript through game development"
- ✅ "High school coder exploring front-end development"

**Avoid:**
- ❌ "idk just coding i guess" (too casual)
- ❌ Empty bio (missed opportunity)
- ❌ "Best coder ever" (comes across poorly)

## Parent Note

Helping your child set up a professional online presence:

**Discuss:**
- What's appropriate to share publicly
- Choosing a professional bio
- Profile picture guidelines (school-appropriate)
- Long-term thinking (colleges/employers may view this)

**Privacy:**
- No need to share full name if you don't want to
- Location can be general ("USA" instead of specific address)
- Email is private (not shown publicly)

**Remember:** Your profile grows with you. You can always update it as you build more projects!
